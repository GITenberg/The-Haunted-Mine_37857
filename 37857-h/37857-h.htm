<p class="p6 center b2">THE HAUNTED MINE.</p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE SALE OF "OLD HORSE."</h3>

<p>"Going for twenty-five cents. Going
once; going twice; going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty cents."</p>

<p>"Thirty cents! Gentlemen, I am really
astonished at you. It is a disgrace for me to
take notice of that bid. Why, just look at
that box. A miser may have hidden the secret
of a gold-mine in it. Here it is, neatly
dovetailed, and put together with screws instead
of nails; and who knows but that it
contains the treasure of a lifetime hidden
away under that lid? And I am bid only
thirty cents for it. Do I hear any more?
Won't somebody give me some more? Going
for thirty cents once; going twice; going three
times, and sold to that lucky fellow who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
stands there with a uniform on. I don't
know what his name is. Step up there and
take your purchase, my lad, and when you
open that box, and see what is in it, just bless
your lucky stars that you came to this office
this afternoon to buy yourself rich."</p>

<p>It happened in the Adams Express office,
and among those who always dropped around
to see how things were going was the young
fellow who had purchased the box. It was
on the afternoon devoted to the sale of "old
horse"&mdash;packages which had lain there for a
long time and nobody had ever called for
them. When the packages accumulated so
rapidly that the company had about as many
on hand as their storeroom could hold, an
auctioneer was ordered to sell them off for
whatever he could get. Of course nobody
could tell what was in the packages, and
somebody always bought them by guess.
Sometimes he got more than his money's
worth, and sometimes he did not. That very
afternoon a man bought a package so large
and heavy that he could scarcely lift it from
the counter, and so certain was he that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
got something worth looking at that he did
not take the package home with him, but borrowed
a hammer from one of the clerks and
opened it on the spot, the customers all gathering
around him to see what he had. To
the surprise of everybody, he turned out half
a dozen bricks. A partner of the man to
whom the box was addressed had been off
somewhere to buy a brickyard, and, not satisfied
with the productions of the yard, had enclosed
the bricks to the man in St. Louis, to
see how he liked them. The purchaser gazed
in surprise at what he had brought, and then
threw down the hammer and turned away;
but by the time he got to the door the loud
laughter of everybody in the office&mdash;and the
office was always full at the sale of "old
horse"&mdash;caused him to arrest his steps. By
that time he himself was laughing.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen," said
he; "those bricks, which are not worth a
nickel apiece, cost me just two dollars."</p>

<p>He was going on to say something more,
but the roar that arose caused him to wait
until it was all over. Then he went on:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>"I have spent fifty dollars for 'old horse,'
and if anybody ever knows me to spend
another dollar in that way I will give him my
head for a football. A man who comes here
to squander his money for anything like that
is a dunce, and ought to have a guardian appointed
over him. I wish you all a very good
day."</p>

<p>But in spite of this man's experience, Julian
Gray had invested in this box because he
thought there was something in it. He did
not care for what the auctioneer said to him,
for he talked that way to everybody; but
Julian knew there were no bricks in it, for it
was done up too neatly. The box was not
more than twelve inches long and half as
wide, and by shaking it up and down the boy
became aware that there were papers of some
kind in it. He paid the clerk the amount of
his bid upon it, picked up his purchase, and
started for the door, paying no heed to the
remarks that were offered for his benefit.
There he met another boy, dressed in a uniform
similar to the one he himself wore, and
stopped to exchange a few words with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you got something at last," said the
boy. "It is not bricks, I can swear to that."</p>

<p>"No, sir, it is not," said Julian. "Lift it.
It contains papers of some kind."</p>

<p>"Why don't you open it, and let us see
what is in it?"</p>

<p>"I won't do that, either. I am not going
to have the whole party laughing at me the
way they served that man a little while ago.
Come up to my room when Jack comes home,
and then I will open it."</p>

<p>"I would not be in your boots for a good
deal when Jack sees that box," said the boy,
hurrying away. "He says you have no
business to spend the small earnings you get
on such gimcracks as 'old horse.'"</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Julian, settling the
box under his arm and going away in the
opposite direction. "I've got the box, and if
Jack does not want to see what is in it, he
need not look."</p>

<p>Julian broke into a run,&mdash;he knew he had
no business to spend as much time in that
express office as he had done,&mdash;and in a few
minutes reached the headquarters of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Western Union Telegraph Company, in whose
employ he was. He laid down his book of
receipts for the dispatches he had delivered,
then picked up his box again and stowed it
away under the counter, where he was sure
it would be out of everybody's way.</p>

<p>"I don't care," Julian repeated to himself,
when he recalled what his older companion,
Jack Shelden, would have to say to him when
he found that he had been investing in "old
horse." "I don't know that I expect to make
anything out of it, but somehow or other I
can't resist my curiosity to know what is in
those bundles. When you can get the packages
for little or nothing, where's the harm?
But that is no way to save my money. I will
never go near that express office again."</p>

<p>With this good resolution, Julian took his
seat among the other boys and waited in silence
for the operator to call upon him to deliver
a dispatch. It came at last, and during
the rest of the afternoon Julian was kept
busy. When six o'clock came he put his box
under his arm and started for home. His
duties were done for that day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>The place that Julian called home was a
long way from the office, for, being a poor
boy, he was obliged to room where he could
get it as cheaply as possible. He passed
along several streets, turned numerous corners,
and finally sprang up the stairs in a sorry-looking
house which seemed almost ready to
tumble down, and when he reached the top
he found the door of his room open. There
he met his chum, who had already returned
from his work, going about his preparations
for supper, and whistling as though he felt at
peace with himself and all the world.</p>

<p>"Halloo!" he exclaimed, as Julian came
in. "What's the news to-day? Well, there.
If you haven't been to that old express office
again!"</p>

<p>These two boys were orphans&mdash;or at least
Jack was. Julian had a stepfather who,
when his mother died, told the boy that he
could not support him any longer, and that
he must look out for himself. He no doubt
expected that the boy would find himself in
the poorhouse before he had been long out of
his care; but Julian was not that sort of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
fellow. He wandered aimlessly about the
streets, looking for something to do, sleeping
in dry-goods boxes or on a plank in some
lumber-yard; and one morning, while passing
along the street, wondering where he was
going to get something to eat, he saw a scene
that thrilled him with excitement. A span
of horses was running away, and a telegraph
operator&mdash;Julian knew that he was an operator
from the uniform he wore&mdash;in making
an attempt to stop them, lost his footing and
fell on the ground right in front of the frantic
team. Julian was nearer to him than anybody
else, and acting upon the impulse of the
moment, but scarcely knowing why he did
so, he dashed forward, seized the young man
by the shoulders, and pulled him out of the
way. It was all done in an instant, and
Julian shuddered when he thought of what
he had done.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lad," said the man, when
he got up, brushed the dust from his clothes,
and looked after the flying horses. "You
saved my life, but you couldn't save the man
in the buggy. Now, what can I give you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want anything, sir," said Julian.
The man was neatly dressed, and looked as
though he had some money, and Julian had
more than half a mind to ask him for enough
with which to get some breakfast. But he
concluded that he would not do it; he would
look farther, and he was sure that he could
get something to do, such as sweeping out
a store, and earn some breakfast in that
way.</p>

<p>"You don't want anything?" exclaimed
the man. "Well, you are the luckiest fellow
I ever saw!"</p>

<p>The man now turned and gave Julian a
good looking over. It was not necessary that
he should ask any questions, for poverty was
written all over him.</p>

<p>"Where's your home?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I haven't any, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you had any breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, here's enough to enable you to get
a good fill-out," said the man, pulling out a
dollar. "Get the very best breakfast you can,
and then come down to the Western Union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Telegraph office and ask for Wiggins. I will
see what I can do for you."</p>

<p>The man hurried away, and Julian looked
at the dollar he held in his hand, then gazed
in the direction in which his benefactor had
gone, and could hardly believe that he was
awake. A dollar was a larger sum of money
than he had ever had before.</p>

<p>Of course Julian followed the operator's instructions.
When he reached the Western
Union Telegraph office he was asked several
questions about his habits, and what he knew
about the city, and it finally ended by his
being offered employment. Julian jumped at
the chance. He had no money with which to
purchase a uniform, but Wiggins got around
that, and he had been there ever since, trying
hard to do his duty, except in one particular,
and his highest ambition was to become an
operator.</p>

<p>Long before this time he made the acquaintance
of Jack Sheldon, who finally came
to room with him, and they had been fast
friends ever since. Jack had formerly gained
a good living by shining boots and shoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
around the St. Louis foundry-works, until one
day the master mechanic, who had taken a
wonderful shine to him, offered to take him
away from his blacking-brush and give him a
position where he could make a man of himself.
Jack was waiting for this, and he
promptly closed with it. Of course his wages
were small now, but he wanted to get away
from the bootblacks and mingle with persons
more like himself, and when Julian made him
a proposition to take him in as a roommate,
Jack was only too glad to agree to it. He was
but a year older than Julian, but he often took
it upon himself to advise him; and one thing
he could not stand was Julian's longing to
find out what was concealed in those packages
that every once in a little while were sold in
the express office. Being economical himself,
and never spending a cent unless absolutely
necessary, he wanted to make his companion
so, too.</p>

<p>"That is no way for you to save money,
Julian," said Jack. "To go to that express
office when you ought to be at your work, and
spending money for 'old horse' when you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
don't know what is in the bundle you bid on,
is the very way for you to wear a poor man's
clothes the longest day you live. I want to
go into business myself some time, and I
should think you would, too."</p>

<p>This was the way he talked to Julian every
time he brought home a bundle of "old
horse," and he was ready to talk to him now
in the same way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>CASPER IS DISGUSTED.</h3>

<p>"Well, you have been to that old express
office again and invested some
of your hard earnings in 'old horse,' haven't
you?" repeated Jack, placing his hands on
his hips and looking sullenly at the box,
which Julian placed upon the table. "Is that
any way for you to save your money?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not; but, Jack, I've got something
in this," said Julian. "See how nicely
this box is done up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care to know anything about it,"
said Jack, turning away and going on with
his preparations of getting supper. "That is
the only thing I have against you. What do
you care what is in those bundles? If they
were worth anything don't you suppose that
the people to whom they were addressed would
have come after them? How much money
have you got in bank, anyway?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>"About forty dollars, I guess, including
tips and everything."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got a hundred," said Jack.
"You will never be able to go into business
by doing this way."</p>

<p>"Lend me your knife and talk about it
afterward. I want to get these screws out."</p>

<p>"Take your own knife. I don't want to
have mine broken."</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to remember one thing,
Jack. If I get anything out of this box, it
is mine entirely. You will have no interest
in it."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;I will agree to that."</p>

<p>Seeing that he must depend entirely upon
himself to get his box open, Julian took his
knife from his pocket and went to work upon
the screws; but they had been put there to
stay, and he finally gave it up in disgust.
Then Jack relented and came to his assistance.
The strong blade of his knife presently
worked the screws loose, and the inside
of the box was revealed to them. There was
nothing but a mass of papers, which looked
so ancient that Jack declared they had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
through two or three wars. He took one look
at them, and then went on with his work of
getting supper.</p>

<p>"What's the use of fooling away your time
with that stuff?" said he. "That's all your
'old horse' amounts to. If you are going to
spend money in that way, I wish you would
get something that is of some use."</p>

<p>Julian did not reply. He took his box to
an out-of-the-way corner where he would not
be in Jack's way, and devoted himself to the
reading of the first paper he took up.</p>

<p>"Who's Haberstro?" said he.</p>

<p>"Don't know him," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter addressed to him."</p>

<p>"What is in it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to know something about
it, now, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. If we can find out who
Haberstro is, we must take the letter to him."</p>

<p>Julian began and read the letter, which
was written in a very plain hand, and before
he had read a page of it he stopped and
looked at Jack, while an expression of astonishment
came to his face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on with it," said Jack; "we might as
well know it all."</p>

<p>Julian "went on with it," and when he got
through he had read a very good description
of a gold-mine located somewhere out West,
and inside the letter was a map which would
lead anyone straight to it. There was one
thing in it that did not look exactly right,
and here is the passage that referred to it:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"They have got the story around that the mine is
haunted, but don't you believe it. I worked for
almost six months in that mine alone after my partner
took sick and died, going down into it and
shovelling the dirt in, coming up and hoisting the
bucket out, and went through the process of washing,
and I never found anything to scare me yet. I
took out, with every bucketful I washed, anywhere
from ten to fifty dollars; anyway, I got fifty thousand
dollars out of it. There is one thing about it: the
mine is fully five miles from anybody's place, and
in all that region you won't find a man who will
prospect anywhere near you. It shows that all the
country about Dutch Flat is not played out yet."
</p>

<p>A little farther on the letter spoke of the
manner in which the miner came to turn his
claim over to Haberstro:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"You know that very shortly after we got there
my partner died, and was buried near the mine.
Perhaps that has something to do with the story of
the mine's being haunted. I went to work and dug
in the claim alone, not knowing anything about
mining, until I made the sum that I told you of.
Finally I received a letter from some lawyer in
Europe, who told me that my father had died and
left me heir to all his wealth. He urged me to come
home and settle my claim at once, and who should
my mind revert to but to you, old fellow, who stood
by me when I was sick unto death. I know that we
did not have the stamps to buy a mule-halter, but
that did not make any sort of difference to you.
You stayed at my back until I got well; and as I
can't pay you in any other way I give you this
mine, hoping it will make you as rich as it did me.
More than that, for fear that the mine may play out
on you, which I don't believe, I give you the deeds
of several little pieces of property located in Denver
and vicinity, which you will find will be more than
enough to run you, even if you don't choose to go
mining. For me, nothing would suit me. You
know how you used to rail at me because I wanted
to go from one thing to another. After I had accumulated
that property in Denver, I had to go and
look for claims, and that is the way I come to have
this mine.</p>

<p>"I send all these things to you by express, for I
am in New York, now, and all ready to sail. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the time you get them I shall be on the deep sea. I
forgot to say that the property which I have given to
you for your kindness to me is worth, in round
numbers, one hundred thousand dollars. Take it,
and live happily with it. I don't know that I shall
ever see you again; but if I do not, remember that
my blessing always goes with you."
</p></div>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you think of that?"
said Julian, as he folded up the letter.</p>

<p>Jack Sheldon did not know what to say.
He sat with a case-knife in his hand and with
one leg thrown over the table, his mouth
open, and listening with all his ears to the
contents of the letter.</p>

<p>"I tell you that auctioneer uttered a prophecy
when he said that some miser had hidden
the secret of a gold-mine inside the lid of that
box," said Julian. "He told me that when
I got home and opened this thing I would
bless my lucky stars that I had come to that
office to buy myself rich."</p>

<p>"But there is one thing that you don't
think of, Julian," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That we must make every effort to find
this man Haberstro."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Julian, with a sigh, "I did
think of that. But it seems hard to have so
much money in our grasp, and then to have
it all slip away."</p>

<p>"Of course it does. But that is the honest
way of going at it."</p>

<p>"Here's the deeds for a block of buildings
that cost this man twenty-five thousand dollars,"
said Julian, continuing to examine the
papers in the box.</p>

<p>"Oh, put the box away," said Jack. "And
he gives it all to this man Haberstro. We
must find him, Julian, the first thing we do.
Who's that coming upstairs, I wonder?"</p>

<p>The boys turned toward the door, which
opened almost immediately, admitting Casper
Nevins, the boy who had met Julian at the
express office. There was something about
the boy that Jack did not like. He could
not have told what it was, but there are those
we meet in every-day life who have certain
traits of character that excite our suspicions.
Jack had often warned Julian to keep away
from him, and the latter did not cultivate his
acquaintance any more that he could help;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
but, being employed in the same office that
Casper was, of course he was thrown into his
company oftener than he desired.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, boys," said Casper. "I
was on my way home, and I thought I would
drop in and see what Julian bought to-day at
the express office. You promised to show me
if I would come up," he added, turning to
Julian.</p>

<p>"I did, and there it is," said Julian, passing
over the letter. "Sit down in this chair.
We are so poor just now that we have only
one chair apiece, but when we get out to our
gold-mine we shall have two chairs."</p>

<p>"Ah! You have a gold-mine, have you?"
said Casper, with a smile. "When do you
start?"</p>

<p>"Read the letter, and you will think we
ought to start right away," said Julian, while
Jack got up and proceeded with his supper.
"We think of starting to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"I would like to have my hand on your
coat-tail about the time you get out there,"
said Casper. "Now, the question is, does
the mine pay anything?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>"Read the letter, and you will understand
as much as we do."</p>

<p>Casper began the letter, and he had not
gone far with it before he broke out with
"Jerusalem!" and "This beats me!" and
"Fifty thousand dollars!" When he had got
done with the letter, he folded it up and passed
it back to Julian without saying a word.</p>

<p>"And that is not all of it," said the latter.
"Do you see the rest of the papers there in
that box? Well, they are deeds of property
which amount to one hundred thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Casper. "By gracious!
You're lucky&mdash;are you not? When do you
start?"</p>

<p>"Laying all jokes aside, we don't intend to
start at all," said Jack.</p>

<p>"You don't?" exclaimed Casper. "Have
you got something better on hand?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know that we have; but our
first hard work must be to find this man
Haberstro. It would not be right for us to
keep what is in that box without turning the
city upside down in order to locate him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the box was sold to you, was it
not?" said Casper, turning to Julian.</p>

<p>"Of course it was. Didn't I pay thirty
cents of my hard earnings for it?"</p>

<p>"Did you agree to hunt up this man Haberstro?"</p>

<p>"No, because the clerks did not know
where he was."</p>

<p>"Then I say the box and everything in it
belongs to you. Undoubtedly the man does
not live here any more. He has gone somewhere
else. I would not make a precious fool
of myself, if I were you. Take the money
and say nothing to nobody."</p>

<p>"And go out there and take possession of
that property while there is another man
waiting for it?" asked Jack, with some heat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that's what I would do."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, you are not honest. I am glad
you don't train in my crowd."</p>

<p>"I don't call it dishonest in holding fast
to what you have. A hundred thousand dollars!
You would not need to go mining
at all."</p>

<p>"We are well aware of that; but we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
find out where that man lives, if we can.
After having exhausted every means to find
out, then I would consider that the property
belongs to us. Julian, we will have to see a
lawyer about that."</p>

<p>"That's what I was thinking," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the plumb dunces that ever I
saw, you are the beat!" said Casper, getting
up and putting on his hat. "I tell you that
if that property was mine I would never let
anyone know that I had it. I would throw
up my position to-morrow, borrow money, go
out there and take possession; and you are
fools if you don't do it."</p>

<p>And Casper went out, slamming the door
behind him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>JULIAN IS ASTONISHED.</h3>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you think of that?"
asked Julian, when he heard the
noise the telegraph boy made in running
down the stairs. "He really acts as though
he were mad about it."</p>

<p>"He is a dishonest fellow," said Jack, once
more coming up to the table and throwing his
leg over it. "You don't believe everything
he said, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not much, I don't," replied Julian, emphatically.
"I could not go out there and
work the mine as he talks of doing. I should
think it was haunted, sure enough."</p>

<p>"Well, put the papers away, and then let
us have supper. While we are doing that, we
will decide what we are going to do with the
box."</p>

<p>"I say, don't let us do anything with it.
We will put it up there on the mantel, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
when we are through supper one of us will
write an advertisement calling upon Mr.
Haberstro to come up and show himself. I
guess the <i>Republican</i> is as good a paper as
any, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But Haberstro may be a Democrat, instead
of a Republican," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Well, then, put it in both papers. That
will cost us two dollars&mdash;seventy-five cents for
the first insertion and a quarter for the
second."</p>

<p>It did not take the boys a long time to get
their supper. They had nothing but bacon,
baker's bread, tea, and a few cream cakes
which Jack had purchased on his way home;
but there was an abundance, they were hungry,
and they did full justice to it. After
supper came something that everybody hates&mdash;washing
the dishes; but that was something
the two friends never neglected. The dishes
must be washed some time, and the sooner it
was done the sooner it would be over with.
Then one picked up the broom and went to
sweeping, while the other lighted the lamp
and brought out the writing materials.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"I have already made up my mind what I
want to say," said Julian, who, being a better
scribe than his companion, handled the pen.
"Wait until I get the advertisement all written
out, and then I will read it to you."</p>

<p>The pen moved slowly, and by the time
that Jack had finished sweeping and seated
himself in a chair ready to listen, Julian read
the following:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"Information wanted regarding the whereabouts
of S. W. Haberstro, formerly of St. Louis. If he will
communicate with the undersigned he will hear of
something greatly to his advantage. Any relative
or friend of his who possesses the above information
will confer a favor by writing to the name given
below."
</p>

<p>"There; how will that do?" said Julian.
"By the way, whose name shall I sign to it&mdash;yours
or mine?"</p>

<p>"Sign your own name, of course. Your
place of business is much handier than mine."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack, it requires something besides
a knowledge of penmanship to write out
an advertisement for a newspaper. I have
worried over this matter ever since we were at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
supper, and then I didn't know how you
would like it. Now, the next thing is to put
it where it will catch the public eye in the
morning."</p>

<p>The boys did not intend to let the grass
grow under their feet. They put on their
coats and turned down the lamp, but before
they went out they took particular pains to
put the box where they knew it would be
safe. They opened the closet, pushed the box
as far back as they could on the top shelf,
and threw some clothing in front of it to hide
it from anyone who might look in there.
Burglaries were common in the city, and the
boys never left anything in their room that
was worth stealing.</p>

<p>The friends did not ride on the street cars,
for they believed that five cents was worth as
much to them as it was to the conductor, but
walked all the distance that lay between them
and the business part of the city. They
reached the newspaper offices at last, paid for
two insertions in each paper, and went away
satisfied that they had done all in their power
to find Mr. Haberstro.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we have done as we would be done
by," said Julian, "and I believe a glass of
soda water would help me sleep easier. Come
in here."</p>

<p>"We don't want any soda water," exclaimed
Jack, seizing Julian by the arm and
pulling him away from the drug store. "We
don't need it. When we get home we will
take a glass of cold water, and that will do
just as well as all the soda water in town."</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to give in to you,"
said Julian, continuing his walk with Jack,
"but I think we deserve a little credit for
what we have done. Here we are with a
fortune of one hundred thousand dollars in
our pockets, and yet we are anxious to give it
up if Mr. Haberstro shows himself. I tell
you, it is not everybody in the world who
would do that."</p>

<p>"I know it, but that is the honest way of
doing business. I never could look our master
mechanic in the face again if I should go
off and enjoy that money without making
an effort to find the owner."</p>

<p>In due time the boys reached home and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
went to bed, but sleep did not visit their eyes
before midnight. They were thinking of the
fortune that was in their grasp. No one
would have thought these boys very guilty if
they had kept silent about the contents of
that box and had gone off to reap the pleasure
which good luck or something else had
placed in Julian's hands; but such a thought
had never entered their heads until Casper
Nevins had suggested it to them. By being
at the sale of "old horse" Julian had stumbled
upon something that was intended for
Mr. Haberstro, and he was just as much entitled
to the contents of it as anybody.</p>

<p>"But I would be dishonest for all that,"
said he, rolling over in his bed to find a more
comfortable position. "I never could enjoy
that money, for I should be thinking of Mr.
Haberstro, who ought to have it. No matter
whether he is alive or dead, he would come
up beside me all the while, and reach out his
hand to take the money I was getting ready
to use for my own pleasure. No, sir. We
will do the best we can to find Mr. Haberstro,
and if he does not show up within any reasonable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
time, then Jack says the money belongs
to us. I can spend it, then, to get anything
I want, with perfect confidence."</p>

<p>When Julian got to this point in his meditations
he became silent, and thought over the
many things he stood in need of, and which
he thought he could not possibly get along
without, until finally he fell asleep; but the
next morning, when he arose and returned
Jack's hearty greeting, that fortune came into
his mind immediately.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, Jack," said he. "If,
after waiting a few days, we don't hear from
Mr. Haberstro or any of his kin, suppose I go
to Mr. Wiggins with it? He will know exactly
what we ought to do."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jack. "That will be
better than going to a lawyer, for he won't
charge us anything for his advice."</p>

<p>"And shall you keep still about this?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Don't lisp it to anybody. We
don't want somebody to come along here and
claim to be Haberstro, when perhaps he don't
know a thing about what is in the box."</p>

<p>"Of course he would not know a thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
about it," said Julian, in surprise. "Haberstro
himself don't know what there is in the
box. He has got to prove by outside parties
that he is the man that we want, or we can
put him down as a fraud."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Jack, after thinking a
moment. "We must be continually on the
lookout for breakers."</p>

<p>Why was it that Jack did not go further,
and say that they must be continually on the
lookout for the safety of the box when they
were not there to watch over it? It was not
safe from anybody who knew it was there,
and it would have been but little trouble for
them to have taken it with them and put it
into the hands of Mr. Wiggins. If they had
thought of this, no doubt they would have
lost no time in acting upon it.</p>

<p>Long before the hands on Jack's watch had
reached the hour of half-past six the two
friends were on their way toward their places
of business, and when Julian reached the
office almost the first boy he saw was Casper
Nevins, who had denounced them for trying
to find out what became of Mr. Haberstro.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morning, Julian," said he. "Have
you advertised for that man of yours yet?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for?" said
Julian, remembering what Jack had said
about keeping the matter still.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; only I want to tell you that
if you get yourselves fooled out of that fortune
you can thank yourselves for it. What
is there to prevent some sharper from coming
around and telling you that he is Haberstro?
You didn't think of that, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we thought of it," said Julian, with
a smile. "Do you suppose we will take any
man's word for that? He must prove that
he is the man we want, or else we won't have
anything to do with him."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! That is easy enough. I can find
fifty men right here in this town who will
prove that they are President of the United
States for half of what that box is worth.
Say!" he added, sinking his voice almost to a
whisper, "you haven't said a word to anybody
about advertising for him, have you?"</p>

<p>"No; and I have not said a word to you
about it either," said Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all right, but you can't fool me so
easy. I want to tell you right now that there
are a good many here who know about it, and
that they are bound to have that box. Ah!"
he added, noting the expression that came
upon Julian's face, "you didn't think of <i>that</i>,
did you?"</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>"There were men in the express office
yesterday who know all about it. You needn't
think you are going to keep that express box
hid, for you can't do it. Where did you put
it?"</p>

<p>"It is safe. It is where nobody will ever
think of looking for it."</p>

<p>"Then you are all right," said Casper, who
was plainly very much disappointed because
he did not find out where the box was. "But
you had better keep an eye out for those fellows
in the express office, for, unless the looks
of some of them belied them, they will steal
that box from you as sure as you are a foot
high."</p>

<p>"If they thought so much of the box, why
didn't they buy it in the first place?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>"That is for them to tell. I don't know
but they have somehow got an idea that there
is something in it. You are going to get
fooled out of it, and it will serve you just
right for advertising for Haberstro."</p>

<p>That day was a long one to Julian, for he
could not help turning over in his mind what
Casper had said to him. When he reached
home after his day's work was done he went
straight to the closet, paying no sort of attention
to Jack, who looked at him in surprise,
took a chair with him, and hunted up the
box. It was where he put it, and he drew a
long breath of relief.</p>

<p>"Now, then, I would like to have you explain
yourself," said Jack, after he had waited
some little time for Julian to say what he
meant by his actions.</p>

<p>"It is there," said Julian, "but I have
been shaking in my shoes all day. Did it
ever occur to you that some of those people
who saw me buy the box at the express office
would come up here to take it?"</p>

<p>"No; and I don't believe they will do it."</p>

<p>"Well, Casper said they would."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>"You tell Casper Nevins to keep his long,
meddlesome nose out of this pie and attend
strictly to his own affairs," said Jack, in disgust.
"It is ours, and he has nothing to do
with it. If anybody comes into this room
when we are not here, it will be Casper himself."</p>

<p>"He can't; he has not got a key."</p>

<p>"I know that. If he had, we would have
trouble with that box. What did he say to
you?"</p>

<p>Julian then repeated the conversation he
held with Casper that morning, and Jack
nodded his head once or twice to say that he
approved of it.</p>

<p>"You did perfectly right by declining to
answer his question about advertising for our
man," said Jack. "What did he want to
know that for? If they wanted the box, why
did they not buy it in the first place?"</p>

<p>During the next few days the two friends
were in a fever of suspense, for they did not
want somebody to come and take their fortune
away from them. Every man who came into
the telegraph office Julian watched closely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
for he had somehow got it into his head that
Haberstro must be a German; but every German
who came in there had business of his
own, and as soon as it was done he went out.
No one came to see Julian about the box, and,
if the truth must be told, he began to breathe
easier. Of late he had got out of the habit
of looking for the box as soon as he came
home, and perhaps the sport that Jack made
of him for it was the only thing that made him
give it up.</p>

<p>"One would think you owned that fortune,"
said he. "I don't believe a miser ever watched
his gold as closely as you watch that box."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Julian. "The fortune
is ours, or rather is going to be in a few days.
Now you mark my words, and see if I don't
tell you the truth."</p>

<p>"There's many a slip. We will never have
such luck in the world."</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to look at it now. It
seems to me that if Haberstro is around here
he ought to have put in an appearance before
this time. We have waited a whole week
without seeing anything of him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"A whole week!" exclaimed Jack, with a
laugh. "If you wait a month without seeing
him you may be happy. If we keep the box
for three months without the man appearing,
then I shall think it belongs to us."</p>

<p>Julian did not believe that. He thought
that the contents of the box would belong to
them before that time. He made no reply,
but took a chair to examine the closet. He
moved the clothing aside, expecting every
minute to put his hand upon the box, and
then uttered an exclamation of astonishment
and threw the articles off on the floor.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Jack, in
alarm.</p>

<p>"The box is gone!" replied Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>WHERE THE BOX WAS.</h3>

<p>This startling piece of information seemed
to strike Jack Sheldon motionless and
speechless with astonishment. His under jaw
dropped down, and he even clutched the back
of a chair, as if seeking something with which
to support himself. The two boys stood at
opposite sides of the room looking at each
other, and then Jack recovered himself.</p>

<p>"Gone!" he repeated. "You are mistaken;
you have overlooked it. I saw it
night before last myself."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Julian, emphatically;
"I have taken the clothes all out, and the box
is gone. Look and see for yourself."</p>

<p>Julian stepped down from the chair and
Jack took his place. He peered into every
nook and corner of the dark shelf, passed his
hands over it, and then, with something like
a sigh, got down and began to hang the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
clothes up in their proper places. Then he
closed the door of the closet, took a chair, and
gazed earnestly at the floor.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you think of that?"
said Julian.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you that if anybody came in
here to look for that box while we were not
here it would be Casper Nevins, and nobody
else?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"You surely don't suspect him!" exclaimed
Julian.</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> suspect him; if you could get inside
his room to-night you would find the box."</p>

<p>"Why, then he is a thief!" said Julian,
jumping up from his chair and walking the
floor. "Shall we go down to No. 8 Station
and ask the police to send a man up there and
search him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether that would be the
best way or not," said Jack, reflectively.
"Has Casper got many friends among the
boys of your office?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he's got one friend there
who treats him any better than I do. The
boys are all shy of him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"And well they may be. That boy got a
key somewhere that will fit our door, and
came in here and took that box. You say he
has not any friends on whom he can depend
in the office?"</p>

<p>"Not one. If he has any friends, none of
us know who they are."</p>

<p>"Then he must be alone in stealing the box
from us. He has it there in his room, for he
has no other place to hide it. Do you know
what sort of a key he has to fit his door?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. I was with him when he
got it. It is a combination key; one that he
folds up when he puts it into his pocket."</p>

<p>"Do you believe you can buy another
like it?"</p>

<p>"By George! That's an idea. Let us go
down and find out. Then to-morrow, if I can
get away, I will come up here and go through
his room."</p>

<p>That was Jack's notion entirely. He wanted
to see "the biter bit"&mdash;to know that he would
feel, when he awoke some fine morning and
found his fortune gone, just how they were
feeling now. They put on their coats and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
locked the door,&mdash;it seemed a mockery to them
now to lock the door when their fortune was
gone,&mdash;and, after walking briskly for a few
minutes, turned into the store where Casper
had purchased his key. When Julian told
the clerk that he wanted to see some combination
keys, he threw out upon the counter a
box which was filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>"Do you remember a telegraph boy who
was in here several months ago and bought a
combination lock to fit his door?" asked Julian.
"I was in here at the time, and I know
he bought the lock of you."</p>

<p>"Seems to me that I <i>do</i> remember something
about that," said the clerk, turning
around to the shelves behind him and taking
down another box, "and we have got just one
lock of that sort left."</p>

<p>"Are you sure this key will open his door?"
asked Julian.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. If it don't open his
door, you can bring it back and exchange it
for another."</p>

<p>Julian told him that he would take the
lock, and while the clerk was gone to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
part of the store to do it up he whispered to
Jack,</p>

<p>"I have just thought of something. He
has not any closet in his room that I know
of, and who knows but that he may have put
that box in his trunk? I had better get some
keys to his trunk while I am about it."</p>

<p>"Do you remember how the key looked?"
asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I guess I can come pretty close to it,"
answered Julian.</p>

<p>The work of selecting a key to the trunk
was not so easy; but Julian managed to
satisfy himself at last, and the boys left the
store. Julian did not say anything, but he
was certain that the box would be in his own
possession before that time to-morrow. That
would be better than calling the police to search
his room. In the latter case, Casper would be
held for trial, and Julian did not want to disgrace
him before all the boys in the office.</p>

<p>"I will give Mr. Wiggins the box as soon
as I get my hands on it, but I shan't say anything
to him about Casper's stealing it," said
he. "Would you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>"You are mighty right I <i>would</i>," exclaimed
Jack, who looked at his friend in utter surprise.
"He stole it, didn't he? He was
going to cheat Haberstro out of it if he
showed up, and, failing that, he would leave
us here to work all our lives while he lived
on the fat of the land. No, sir; if you get
the box you must tell Mr Wiggins about it."</p>

<p>For the first time in a long while the boys
did not sleep much that night. Jack was
thinking about Casper's atrocity,&mdash;for he considered
that was about the term to apply to
him for stealing their box,&mdash;and Julian was
wondering if he was going to get into Casper's
room and recover the fortune which he was
attempting to deprive them of.</p>

<p>"I tell you, that boy is coming to some
bad end," said Jack. "I would not be in his
boots for all the money he will ever be
worth."</p>

<p>"I don't care what end he comes to," said
Julian, "but I was just thinking what would
happen to us if this key did not open his
door. We would then have to get the police,
sure enough."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>Morning came at length, and at the usual
hour Julian was on hand in the telegraph
office, waiting to see what his duties were
going to be. As usual, he found Casper
Nevins there. He looked closely at Julian
when he came in, but could not see anything
in the expression of his face that led him to
believe there was anything wrong.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Julian," said he.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Julian. "How do
you feel this morning?"</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet. I feel much better
than you will when you find that that box is
gone," added Casper to himself. "He hasn't
found it out yet, and I hope he will not until
I get my pay. I have waited and watched
for this a long time, and, thank heaven! I
have found it at last. I wish I knew somebody
who would take that box and hide it
for me; but I can't think of a living soul."</p>

<p>All the fore part of that day Julian was
kept busy running to the lower part of the
city with messages, and not a chance did he
get to go up past Casper's room. Two or
three times he was on the point of asking Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Wiggins to excuse him for a few minutes, but
he always shrunk from it for fear of the questions
that gentleman would ask him. "Where
did he want to go?" "What did he want to
go after?" "What was he going to do when
he got there?" and Julian was quite certain
that he could not answer these questions without
telling a lie. While he was thinking it
over he heard his name called, and found
that he must go right by Casper's room in
order to take the message where it was to go.
He seemed to be treading on air when he
walked up to take the telegraphic dispatch.</p>

<p>"Do you know where that man lives?"
asked the operator.</p>

<p>"I know pretty nearly where he lives,"
answered Julian.</p>

<p>"Well, take it there, and be back as soon
as you can, for I shall want to send you somewhere
else. What's the matter with you,
Julian? You seem to be gay about something."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I feel any different
from what I always do," replied Julian. "I
will go there as soon as I can."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>When Julian got into the street, his first
care was to find his keys. They were all
there; and, to gain the time that he would
occupy in looking about the room, Julian
broke into a trot, knowing that the police
would not trouble him while he had that uniform
on. At the end of an hour he began to
draw close to Casper's room, and there he
slackened his pace to a walk.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes more and the matter will be
decided," said Julian, his heart beating with
a sound that frightened him. "That boy
has the box, and I am going to have it."</p>

<p>A few steps more brought him to the stairs
that led up to Casper's room. It was over a
grocery store, and the steps ran up beside it.
He turned in there without anybody seeing
him, and stopped in front of the door. The
combination key was produced, and to Julian's
immense delight the door came open the very
first try.</p>

<p>"I guess I won't lock it," muttered Julian.
"I might lock myself in. He does not keep
his room as neat as we do ours."</p>

<p>Julian took one glance about the apartment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
taking in the tumbled bedclothes, and
the dishes from which Casper had eaten his
breakfast still unwashed on the table, and
then turned his attention to what had brought
him there. There was no closet in the room,
and the box was not under the bed; it must
therefore be in his trunk. One after another
of the keys was tried without avail, and
Julian was about to give it up in despair,
when the last key&mdash;the one on Jack's bunch&mdash;opened
the trunk, which he found in the
greatest confusion. He lifted off the tray,
and there was the box, sure enough. Julian
took it, and hugged it as though it was a
friend from whom he had long been separated.</p>

<p>"Now the next question is, are the papers
all here?" thought he. "There were seven
of them besides the letter, and who knows but
that he has taken a block of buildings away
from us."</p>

<p>But the papers were all there. However
much Casper might have been tempted to
realize on some of the numerous "blocks of
buildings" which the box called for, he dared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
not attempt the sale of any of them. It was
as much as he could do to steal the papers.
Julian placed the tray back and carefully
locked the trunk, and then looking around,
found a paper with which to do up his box.
Then he locked the door, came down, and
went on to deliver his message.</p>

<p>"That boy called us foolish because we advertised
for Mr. Haberstro," said Julian, as
he carefully adjusted the box under his arm.
"I would like to know if we were bigger fools
than he was. We could have found the police
last night as easy as not, and it would
have been no trouble for them to find the
box. He ought not to have left it there in
his trunk. He didn't think that we could
play the same game on him that he played
upon us."</p>

<p>Julian conveyed his message and returned
to his office in less time than he usually did,
and, after reporting, told Mr. Wiggins in a
whisper that he would like to see him in the
back room.</p>

<p>"I know what you want," said Mr. Wiggins,
as he went in. "You have been up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the express office, buying some more of that
'old horse.' Some day I am going to give you
fits for that. It is the only thing I have stored
up against you."</p>

<p>"Can you tell when I did it?" asked Julian,
slowly unfolding the box which he carried
under his arm. "Haven't I carried my
telegraphic dispatches in as little time as anybody?
Now, I have something here that is
worth having. Read that letter, and see if it
isn't."</p>

<p>Mr. Wiggins seated himself on the table
and slowly read the letter which Julian placed
in his hands, and it was not long before he
became deeply interested in it. When he had
got through he looked at the boy with astonishment.</p>

<p>"I declare, Julian, you're lucky," said he.
"Now, the next thing for you to do is to advertise
for Haberstro."</p>

<p>"We have already advertised for him. We
have put four insertions in the papers."</p>

<p>"And he doesn't come forward to claim his
money? Put two other advertisements in, and
if he don't show up the money is yours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>"That is what I wanted to get at," said
Julian, with a sigh of relief. "Now, Mr.
Wiggins, I wish you would take this and lock
it up somewhere. I don't think it safe in our
house."</p>

<p>"Certainly I'll do it. By George! Who
would think you were worth a hundred thousand
dollars!"</p>

<p>"It isn't ours yet," said Julian, with a
smile. "About the time we get ready to use
it, here will come Mr. Haberstro, and we will
have to give it up to him."</p>

<p>"Well, you are honest, at any rate, or you
would not have advertised for him. This
beats me, I declare. I won't scold you this
time, but don't let it happen again."</p>

<p>"I'll never go into that express office again
while I live," said Julian, earnestly. "I have
had my luck once, and I don't believe it will
come again."</p>

<p>When Julian went out into the office he saw
Casper there, and he was as white as a sheet.
Julian could not resist the temptation to pat
an imaginary box under his arm and wink at
Casper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean by that pantomime?"
said he.</p>

<p>"It means that you can't get the start of
two fellows who have their eyes open," said
Julian. "I've got the box."</p>

<p>"You have?" gasped Casper. "You've
been into my room when I was not there?
I'll have the police after you before I am five
minutes older!"</p>

<p>Casper jumped to his feet and began to
look around for his hat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>CASPER THINKS OF SOMETHING.</h3>

<p>Julian stood with his hands in his
pockets looking at Casper, and something
that was very like a smile came into
his face.</p>

<p>"I know what you went in there with Mr.
Wiggins for," said Casper; and having
found his cap by that time, he jammed it
spitefully on his head, "and I just waited
until you came out so that I could ask you.
I don't need to ask you. I tell you once for
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you go on?" asked Julian.
"You will tell me once for all&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>Casper had by this time turned and looked
sternly at Julian, but there was something
about him which told him that he had gone
far enough.</p>

<p>"Go and get the police," said Julian.
"Right here is where I do business. Look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
here, Casper: you came into our room and
stole that box out of our closet."</p>

<p>"I never!" said Casper, evidently very
much surprised. "So help me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't swear, because you will only make
a bad matter worse. I found the box in your
trunk, just where you had left it. The way I
have the matter arranged now, there's nobody
knows that you took it; but you go to work
and raise the police, and I will tell all I know.
If you keep still, I won't say one word."</p>

<p>Casper backed toward the nearest chair and
sat down. This conversation had been carried
on in whispers, and there was nobody, among
the dozen persons who were standing around,
that had the least idea what they were talking
about. If Casper supposed that he was
going to scare Julian into giving up the box,
he failed utterly.</p>

<p>"I won't give up that fortune," said he, to
himself, when Julian turned away to go to his
seat. "A hundred thousand dollars! I'll
have it, or I'll never sleep easy again."</p>

<p>During the rest of the day Julian was as
happy as he wanted to be. The box was now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
safe in the hands of Mr. Wiggins, and he
would like to see anybody get hold of it.
Furthermore, Mr. Wiggins had told him to
put two more advertisements in the papers,
and, if Mr. Haberstro did not show himself
in answer to them, the money was his own.</p>

<p>"I do hope he won't come," said Julian.
"I don't believe in giving up that fortune."</p>

<p>The boy was glad when the day was done,
and the moment he was safe on the street he
struck a trot which he never slackened until
he ran up the stairs to his room. Jack was
there, as he expected him to be, and he was
going about his work of getting supper. He
looked up as Julian came in, and he saw at a
glance that he had been successful.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" shouted Julian; and, catching
Jack by the arm, he whirled him around
two or three times. "It was in the trunk, just
as I told you it was. Mr. Wiggins has it now,
and he will take care of it, too."</p>

<p>"That's the best news I have heard in a
long time," said Jack, throwing his leg over
the table. "Did you tell Mr. Wiggins about
the way Casper acted?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I did not. Somehow, I couldn't bear
to see the boy discharged. I simply told Mr.
Wiggins that it wasn't safe in our room."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but that was the best
way, after all," said Jack, looking reflectively
at the floor. "But I tell you, if I had been
in your place I would have let it all out. Now
tell me the whole thing."</p>

<p>Julian pulled off his coat, and, while he assisted
Jack in getting supper, told him all that
passed between Mr. Wiggins and himself, not
forgetting how the latter had promised to scold
him at some future time for going to the express
office and investing in "old horse."</p>

<p>"I hope he will tell you some words that
will set," said Jack. "All I can say to you
has no effect upon you."</p>

<p>"I will never go near that express office
again&mdash;never!" said Julian, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I hope you will always bear that in
mind."</p>

<p>"I've had my luck, and if I live until my
head is as white as our president's I never
shall have such good fortune again. I will
get bricks the next time I buy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>"You had better sit down and write out
that advertisement for two more insertions,
and after supper we'll take it down and put
it in. If Haberstro does not appear in answer
to them the money is ours. That's a little
better fortune than I dared to hope for."</p>

<p>Anybody could see that Jack was greatly
excited over this news, but he tried not to
show it. If he had gone wild over it, he
would have got Julian so stimulated that he
would not have known which end he stood
on. He had to control himself and Julian,
too. He ate his supper apparently as cool as
he ever was, and after the room had been
swept up and the dishes washed he put on his
coat and was ready to accompany his friend
to the newspaper offices.</p>

<p>"Remember now, Julian, we don't want
any soda water to-night," said Jack. "If
you want anything to drink, get it before you
start."</p>

<p>Julian promised that he would bear it in
mind, and during the three hours that they
were gone never asked for soda water or anything
else.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"Just wait until I get that fortune in my
hands, and then I will have all the soda water
I want," said Julian to himself. "But, after
all, Jack's way is the best. I don't know
what I should do without him."</p>

<p>In due time the boys were at home and in
bed; and leaving them there to enjoy a good
night's rest, we will go back to Casper Nevins
and see what he thought and what he did
when he found that he had lost the box he
had risked so much to gain. He was about
as mad as a boy could hold when he ran down
the stairs after his interview with them in
their room, and he straightway began to rack
his brain to see if he could not get that box
for himself.</p>

<p>"Of all the dunces I ever saw, those two
fellows are the beat!" said he, as he took his
way toward his room. "They have got the
fortune in their own hands; no one will say a
word if they use it as though it was their
own; and yet they are going to advertise for
the man to whom it was addressed. Did anybody
ever hear of a fool notion like that? I
was in hopes that I could get them to go partners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
with me, but under the circumstances I
did not like to propose it. Why didn't I
happen into that express office and bid on
that box? Gee! What a fortune that would
be!"</p>

<p>Casper was almost beside himself with the
thought, and he reached his room and cooked
and ate his supper, still revolving some plan
for obtaining possession of that box. He had
suddenly taken it into his head that he ought
to go into partnership with the two boys in
order to assist them in spending their money,
although there was not the first thing that he
could think of that induced the belief. Julian
had always been friendly with him,&mdash;much
more so than any of the other boys in the
office,&mdash;although he confessed that he had not
always been friendly with Julian.</p>

<p>"Of course I have little spats with him,
but Julian isn't a fellow to remember that,"
said Casper to himself. "I've had spats with
every boy, and some of them I don't want
anything more to do with. But Julian ought
to take me into partnership with him, and I
believe I'll ask him. But first, can't I get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
that box for my own? That is an idea worth
thinking of."</p>

<p>It was an idea that had suddenly come into
Casper's head, and he did not think any more
about the partnership business just then.
Of course their advertising for Haberstro
knocked all that in the head; but then if he
had the box he could do as he pleased with it.
The next day, at the office, he did say something
about partnership, but Julian laughed
at him. He said that he and Jack could
easily spend all that money, and more too, if
they had it. It was made in a joking way,
and Julian had not thought to speak to Jack
about it.</p>

<p>"It is no use trying you on," said Casper
to himself, getting mad in a minute. "You
can spend all that money yourselves, can
you? I'll bet you don't. There must be
some keys in the city that will fit your door,
and I am going to have one."</p>

<p>From that time forward Casper had but
just one object in view, and that was to get
the box. He spent three days in trying the
different keys which he had purchased to fit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the lock, and one time he came near getting
himself into difficulty. He was out a great
deal longer than he ought to have been with
a message, and when he got to the office Mr.
Wiggins took him to task for it.</p>

<p>"How is this, Casper?" said he. "You
have been gone three-quarters of an hour
longer than you ought to have been."</p>

<p>"I went just as soon as I could," replied
Casper, who was not above telling a lie.
"The man wasn't at his place of business, and
so I went to his home."</p>

<p>"Then you are excusable. It seems strange
that he should be at home at this hour."</p>

<p>Casper did not say anything, but he was
satisfied that he was well out of that scrape.
He had not been to the man's home at all.
He was trying the lock on Julian's door.</p>

<p>Although he made two attempts without
getting in, he succeeded on the third. The
door came open for him, and after searching
around the room in vain for the box, he looked
into the closet.</p>

<p>"Aha! I've got you at last!" said he, as
he drew the clothing aside and laid hold of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the object of his search. "Now I wish I had
my money that is due me from the telegraph
office. To-morrow would see me on my way
toward Denver."</p>

<p>Hurriedly locking the door, Casper made
the best of his way down the stairs and to his
room, and put the box into his trunk. Then
he broke into another run and went to the
office, where he arrived in time to avoid a
second reprimand.</p>

<p>"Oh, you feel mighty well now," said Casper,
watching Julian, who was talking and
laughing with some of the boys, "but I bet
you you will feel different in a little while.
Now who am I going to get to hide that box
for me? None of the boys in here will do it,
so I must go elsewhere."</p>

<p>During the rest of the week Casper was as
deeply interested in watching the persons who
came there as Julian was. He did not advertise
for Haberstro, because he did not want to
give up the box. He was more than half inclined
to go to Mr. Wiggins and tell him he
was going to leave when his month was out,
but some way or other he did not. Something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
compelled him to wait, and in three
days more he found out what it was. He was
in the office waiting for a message to deliver,
when Julian came in with a bundle wrapped
up in a newspaper under his arm. Casper
was thunderstruck, for something told him
that Julian had played the same game that he
had. He had been to his room and got the
box. His face grew as pale as death when he
saw Mr. Wiggins follow Julian into the back
room, and his first thought was to leave the
office before he came out.</p>

<p>"It is all up with me now," said he, rising
to his feet and looking around for his cap,
which, boy fashion, he had tossed somewhere,
on entering the room. "He will tell Mr.
Wiggins that I stole the box, and I will be
discharged the first thing. I'll deny it," he
added, growing desperate. "I haven't seen
his box. He did not find it in my room, but
got it somewhere else. I will make a fight on
it as long as I can."</p>

<p>So saying, Casper sat down to await Julian's
return; but the boy came out alone, and the
antics he went through drove Casper frantic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got the box," said Julian, when Casper
asked him what he meant by that pantomime.</p>

<p>The guilty boy was given plenty of opportunity
to "deny it all," but he gave it up in
despair when he found that Julian was not to
be frightened into giving up the box. The
latter was perfectly willing that the police
should come there, but if they did, he would
tell all Casper had done. He might get Julian
in a scrape, but he would get into a worse one
himself. He was glad when Julian moved off
to his chair and left him alone.</p>

<p>"I guess it is the best way as it is," said
Casper, getting upon his feet and looking out
into the street. "If he sets the police onto
me&mdash;good gracious, what should I do? So
that plan has failed, and now the next thing
is something else. I'll have that box, or die
trying to get it."</p>

<p>All that day, while he was in the office or
carrying his telegraphic dispatches around the
street, Casper thought of but one thing, and
that was, how was he going to get that box
again? He did not have much to say to anybody,
and when six o'clock came he lost no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
time in getting home. He had evidently determined
upon something, for he ate a very
scanty supper, changed his clothes, and hurried
out again. His changing his uniform
for a citizen's suit was something that would
have brought him his instant discharge if his
company officers had found him in that fix.
He could mingle with loafers about the pool-rooms,
and no one could have told that he
was any different from anybody else. He
could drink his beer, too, and no one would
suspect that he was going back on the pledge
he made to the company. But, then, Casper
was used to such things, and he thought nothing
of it. More than that, he had an object
to gain, and he had already picked out the
person whom he hoped to induce to enter into
a scheme to possess that box.</p>

<p>"Claus is the fellow I am going to try,"
said he, as he hurried along toward a pool-room
which he often frequented. "He is a
German, he is well along in years, and I
know he isn't above making a dime or two
whenever he gets the chance. Now for it.
It is make or break."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A MR. HABERSTRO APPEARS.</h3>

<p>As Casper Nevins uttered these words he
turned into an entry, ran up a flight of
stairs, and opened the door of the pool-room.
The apartment was always crowded at night,
and the players were mostly young men who
ought by rights to have been somewhere else.
One end of the room was occupied with pool-tables,
and the other was taken up by billiards,
which were in full blast. Casper gave
out among the players that he was a broker's
clerk, and the story seemed to satisfy the
young men, who asked no further questions.
There was no chance for him in a pool game,
and consequently he did not look for it. He
looked all around, and finally discovered his
man Claus, who was sitting near one of the
tables, watching the game.</p>

<p>This man was one of the loafers about the
pool-rooms. He always dressed very neatly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
but he was never known to have any money.
He was a German, and that fitted the name
of the man to whom the box was addressed.</p>

<p>"I am living on the interest of my debts,"
said he, when some one asked what his occupation
was. "I never have any money. I
don't need it. I can get along without it.
You fellows have to work every day, while I
do nothing but sit around the pool-room and
wait for some one to challenge me for a
game."</p>

<p>"But you must make some money sometime,
or else you couldn't play pool as often
as you do."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, I make a dollar or two
when I find the right man who can play a
little, and sometimes I make more. If I
could get a chance to make a hundred thousand
dollars I would take it in a minute.
After that, I would not be obliged to work."</p>

<p>These remarks were made in the presence
of Casper Nevins, who remembered them.
After he had stolen the box, and before
Julian had got it back again, he thought it
best to try him on a new tack.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"Supposing you didn't get a hundred thousand
dollars the first time trying," said he.
"Would not fifty thousand do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think I could live on that much.
Fifty thousand would tempt me awfully. I
wish I had a chance to try it."</p>

<p>"There is Claus, and I am going to speak
to him the first thing I do," said Casper. "If
there is anybody who can play the part of the
missing Haberstro, he is the man."</p>

<p>"Ah! Good-evening, Casper," he exclaimed,
as the boy approached him. "How
is the brokerage business to-day? Have you
made any money?"</p>

<p>"I don't make any. The boss does all
that."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you pick up some money
and go in yourself? You will never be a
man in the world as long as you stay in the
background. Do you want to see me? Here
I am, and all ready for business. Is there
any money in this thing you have to propose?"</p>

<p>Claus, following Casper's lead, occupied an
arm-chair in a remote corner of the room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
away from everybody, and Casper sat down
alongside of him. It was not any work for
him to begin the conversation, for Claus "had
given himself away" every time the subject
of money was introduced.</p>

<p>"Were you in earnest the other day when
you said that if you had a chance to steal a
hundred thousand dollars you would try it
on?" said Casper. "I want you to deal fairly
with me now. I want to know just how you
feel about it."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I was never more in earnest
in my life," said Claus emphatically. "Just
give me a chance, and you will see whether or
not I meant what I said."</p>

<p>"Well, I have got a chance for you to
make something," said Casper.</p>

<p>"You have? Let her rip. I am all attention.
But hold on a bit. Let us get a cigar.
Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"I have ten cents."</p>

<p>"That is enough. Anything to keep our
jaws puffing. I can listen a great deal better
with a cigar than I can without it."</p>

<p>The two arose from their seats and made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
trip to the bar. They lighted their cigars,
and Casper paid ten cents for them. It made
no difference to Claus that Casper had paid
out some of his hard earnings and wondered
where his next morning's breakfast was coming
from. As long as he got the cigar, it
mattered little to him whether Casper had
any more money or not.</p>

<p>"Now I am all ready to listen," said Claus,
seating himself in his arm-chair once more.
"Be explicit; go into all the minuti, so that
I may know what I have to do."</p>

<p>There was no need that Claus should tell
Casper this, and for the next fifteen minutes
Claus never said a word, but listened intently.
He told about Julian's habit of going to the
express office on the day that "old horse"
was offered for sale, until finally he bought
the secret of a gold-mine which was hidden
away in a box that came near being sold for
twenty-five cents. The box was addressed to
S. W. Haberstro, and the boys had put four
advertisements in the papers asking that man
to show himself; and, if he did not show up in
reasonable time, the money was to be theirs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is a copy of the <i>Democrat</i>, with a
copy of the advertisement in it," said Casper.
"I knew you would want to know everything,
and so I brought it along. A hundred thousand
dollars! Now, why couldn't I have bid
on that box? That little snipe does not get
any more money than I do, and yet he had to
go and buy himself rich."</p>

<p>"Then it seems that you are not a broker's
clerk after all," said Claus. "I don't know
as I blame you."</p>

<p>"You see I would get discharged if any of
the company officers should find me dressed
up in citizen's rig," said Casper. "I can go
among the boys, now, and have a good time."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I blame you," repeated
Claus. "I will keep your secret. Well,
go on. I begin to understand the matter
now."</p>

<p>"I tell you I was mad when I found out
that they were going to advertise for old man
Haberstro," said Casper. "I called them
everything but decent boys, and went to work
to conjure up some plan for getting the box
for my own. I got it, too&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"You did? Then you are all right."</p>

<p>"Not so near right as you think I am. Julian
got some keys that would fit my door,
and went in and stole it."</p>

<p>"Whew! They are a desperate lot; ain't
they?"</p>

<p>"That is just what they did; and, furthermore,
Julian gave the box into the hands of
Mr. Wiggins, our chief telegraph operator.
Now, I want you to come down there, pass
yourself off for Haberstro, and claim that
box. Can you do it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Claus did not answer immediately. He
stretched his legs out before him and slid
down in his chair until his head rested on the
back of it. He was thinking over the details
of the plan. Casper did not interrupt
him, but waited to see what he was going to
say about it.</p>

<p>"And you are willing to give me half the
contents of that box if I will get it for you?"
said he. "You have given me the hardest
part of the work. Where do you suppose that
man Wiggins keeps the box?"</p>

<p>"In the bank, of course. He's pretty sharp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and you must look out for that. If we can
get that box, I won't go near the mine. I am
not going to handle a pick and shovel when I
have fifty thousand dollars to fall back upon.
I am not going to work every day when I am
afraid that something will come up and scare
me to death. I will take half the block of
buildings described there, and you can take
the other half. That is fair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is fair enough, but I am afraid of
that man Wiggins. What sort of a looking
man is he?"</p>

<p>"The worst part about him is his eyes.
They are steel-gray, and when he turns them
on a culprit in the office you would think he
was going to look him through. You will
have to be pretty sharp to get around him."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose I go and see Julian first. If
I can get around him, that will be so much
gained."</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a long conversation
between Casper and Claus, and when it
was done the latter felt greatly encouraged,
and told himself that he was nearer getting
the box for his own than he ever was before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Casper told him everything he could think of
that related to the matter, and when Claus
got up, removed his hat and wiped his face
with his handkerchief, Casper said that if he
would just act that way in the presence of Mr.
Wiggins, he would carry the day.</p>

<p>"You act more like a German than I ever
saw you act before," said he. "If you will
just do that way to-morrow, I will answer for
your success."</p>

<p>"I can act the German all over, if that is
what he wants," said Claus, with a laugh.
"You haven't got another ten cents, have
you? Well, let it go. I will go home and
sleep upon it."</p>

<p>"But look here," said Casper, earnestly.
"If you come to that telegraph office you
must not know me. You never saw me before."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I won't give you away.
That money is worth trying for. What is the
reason that you and I have not some good
friends to leave us that amount of money?"</p>

<p>"Because we are not honest enough," said
Casper, bitterly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"Honesty has nothing to do with it. We
ain't sharp; that is what's the matter with us.
Well, good-night. I will go and see Julian
to-morrow night, and the next day I may be
down to the telegraph office. I want to go
easy, because I don't want to spoil the thing
by being too brash."</p>

<p>As it was already late, Casper did not attempt
to enter any game that night. He
went home and tumbled into bed, and for a
long time he lay thinking over what he had
said to Claus. There was another thing that
came into his mind every once in a while,
and that was, where was his breakfast to come
from?</p>

<p>"I was not going to get any cigars to-night,
because ten cents was all I had left,"
said Casper. "But I could not well refuse
Claus. No matter. If he succeeds in getting
that box, I will have all the cigars I
want."</p>

<p>The next morning Casper went to the office
without any breakfast; but the first message
he had to carry took him to a saloon where
they set a free-lunch table. There he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the edge off his appetite and ate enough to
last him until supper-time, when he was to
get his pay. Julian was there, looking as
happy as ever. Casper did not blame him
for that. If he had a box with that amount
of money in it, he would be happy, too.</p>

<p>"By George! It is six o'clock," said Casper,
at length. "In two hours more I will
know what Julian says to Claus. Till then,
I must have patience."</p>

<p>Casper received his money when the others
did, and without saying a word to anybody
set out for home. Julian was not in quite so
big a hurry. He walked along with his
hands in his pockets, and once, when passing
by a baker's shop, he went in and bought
some cakes with which to top off their supper.
Jack Sheldon always reached home before he
did, and Julian found him in his usual act of
getting supper. In reply to his ordinary
greetings, he answered that there had been
nothing unusual going on in the telegraph
office, and that no man who said his name was
Haberstro had been there to see about the advertisement
that had appeared in the papers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack, that fortune in the box
is ours," said Julian. "That man has had
ample time to show up, and it won't be long
before we will be on our way to Denver."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," said Jack.
"Haberstro may be off on a vacation somewhere.
I shall believe we are in Denver
when we get there, and not before."</p>

<p>Almost as Jack said the words there was a
sound of somebody coming up the stairs. He
stopped in front of the door, and called out to
somebody he left below,</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Julian Gray live here? Thank
you;" and a moment afterward his rap
sounded upon the door.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" whispered Jack.
"That's Haberstro, as sure as you live."</p>

<p>For an honest boy, Julian's heart fell. His
fortune was gone, and there were no two ways
about it. He stepped to the door and opened
it, and there stood Claus, more neatly dressed
than ever.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said he, while his eyes
roved from one boy to the other. "Which
one of you is Julian Gray?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to meet you," said he;
and he thrust out his hand, into which Julian
put his own. Then he put his hand into his
pocket and pulled out a card on which the
name S. W. Haberstro was engraved. "I
got belated in my hotel while waiting for the
train, and I picked up this paper and saw
this advertisement in it. As it happened to
be my name, I read it through."</p>

<p>"Come in, sir," said Jack, placing a chair
for him. "It is one of four advertisements
that we put into the daily papers. Your
name is Haberstro, I believe?"</p>

<p>"That is my name. You said you had
something of great value to tell me. What is
it?"</p>

<p>Julian could not have opened his mouth to
save him. He was obliged to let Jack do all
the talking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A PLAN THAT DIDN'T WORK.</h3>

<p>Julian Gray took his stand in one
corner of the room, with his hands in
his pockets and his feet spread out, and
looked at this man who called himself Haberstro.
He was a German, there were no two
ways about that; and he had a habit of taking
out his handkerchief and wiping his face
with it that nobody but a pompous and well-to-do
German ever imitated.</p>

<p>"Do you know of a man of the name of
Winkleman?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Know him?" exclaimed the German.
"Of course I do. He was living here in St.
Louis with me, but all on a sudden he took
the gold fever and went out to Denver. I
was engaged in pretty good business, and so I
did not go with him. I never heard what he
was doing out there. He&mdash;he isn't dead, is
he?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no. He accumulated some property
while he was out there. He got a notice that
his father had died in Europe and left all his
property to him, and he has gone home to
take possession of it."</p>

<p>"Then that accounts for his not writing to
me. He always said that his folks were immensely
rich, and that some day he would
have more than he wanted. What property
did he collect out there?"</p>

<p>"He is worth several buildings which are
worth a hundred thousand dollars. Furthermore,
he has given them to you."</p>

<p>"To me?" cried the German, rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Yes, to you. And, more than that, he
has a mine out of which he took fifty thousand
dollars, and you come into possession of that,
also."</p>

<p>"Lord bless my soul!" exclaimed the German.
"I don't remember that I ever did
anything to him to give him so good an opinion
of me."</p>

<p>"Did you not nurse him while he was
sick?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you not care for your mother when
she was sick?" returned the German. "Of
course that did not amount to anything. He
was my chum, and I had to stand by him."</p>

<p>"Well, he gave you the property for it,
anyway. He sent you the deeds by express,
and Julian bought them for thirty cents."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, that is a heap of money. I
don't know anybody that needs it more than
I do. Where is the box now?"</p>

<p>"It is safe in the hands of Mr. Wiggins.
We were not going to have somebody come
along here and claim to be Haberstro. Have
you anybody here in St. Louis to whom you
can recommend us? We want to know who
you are before we give up the box."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly right and proper. You
see, my home is in Chicago, and I know but
few persons here. If you think this Mr&mdash;&mdash;what
do you call him?"</p>

<p>"Wiggins?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes; if you think he will want somebody
to vouch for me, I can give him the names of
all the Germans in the city. Where does he
hang out?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>"The Union Telegraph office. You know
where that is?"</p>

<p>"I can easily find it, for I have a tongue in
my head. I don't believe I will go near that
mine at all. I will sell it."</p>

<p>"You had better not. The miners have a
story around that it is haunted."</p>

<p>The German threw back his head and
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of that. If he took fifty
thousand dollars out of it, it is surely worth
as much more. Well, if you have told me
everything, I guess I had better go back to
my hotel. I was going back to my home to-night,
but now I am glad I did not go."</p>

<p>"I guess we have told you everything that
pertains to the matter," said Jack. "Do you
think of any questions you would like to ask
us?"</p>

<p>"No; but I may think of some to-morrow.
Good-night."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Jack, as if he had just
thought of something. "Where were you
when this man Winkleman was sick? You
were out in the mines, I suppose?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, we were not; we were here in St.
Louis. If we had been out at the mines,
where no doctor could have been reached, he
would have gone up on my hands. Look
here&mdash;I don't want you to do this for nothing.
Make up your minds what you ought
to have and I will give it to you. If it had
not been for you I would never have seen the
box. Good-night."</p>

<p>The German bowed himself out and closed
the door behind him. The boys waited until
he got to the street, and then Julian took possession
of the chair he had just vacated.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you think of that?"
asked Jack, using companion's expression.</p>

<p>"I think our fortune is gone up," answered
Julian; and then he leaned his elbows on his
knees and looked down at the floor.</p>

<p>Jack laughed as loudly as the German did
a few moments before. Julian straightened
up and looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he exclaimed.
"Is a hundred thousand dollars
such a sum in your eyes that you can afford
to be merry over it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"No; but you will never lose it through
that man. His name is not Haberstro any
more than mine is."</p>

<p>"Jack, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You were so busy with your own thoughts
that you didn't see how I was pumping him,
did you? In the first place he told us that
Winkleman was sick in St. Louis; and yet
Winkleman says in his letter that they were
so poor that they could not raise enough to
buy a halter for a mule. Now, he would not
have used such an expression as that if he
had been here in the city, would he?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think he would," said Julian,
reflectively. "He used the words of the
country in which he lived."</p>

<p>"That is what I think. In the next place,
he said that he was engaged in a paying business
here, and consequently did not go with
Winkleman to the mines; and then, almost in
the same breath, he said he could not refer
me to anybody here because his home was in
Chicago. You didn't see those little errors,
did you?"</p>

<p>Julian began to brighten up. He remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
all the German had said to Jack, but
somehow he did not think of it. The box was
not lost, after all.</p>

<p>"Now, he must have had somebody to post
him in regard to these matters," said Jack.
"Who do you think it was?"</p>

<p>"Casper Nevins!" said Julian, who just
then happened to think of the boy's name.</p>

<p>"That is what I think. He is bound to
have that box, is he not? Don't you give
that box up; do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"I am mighty sure I won't give it up," said
Julian, emphatically. "I shan't give it up
until you are on hand. I had better take
Mr. Wiggins into my confidence to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Of course. Tell him the whole thing.
Tell him about the mistakes this man made
in his conversation with me, and let him draw
his own conclusions. I never saw such a
desperate fellow as that Casper Nevins is.
Now let us go on and get supper."</p>

<p>"I feel a good deal better than I did a few
minutes ago," said Julian, with something
like a long-drawn sigh of relief. "I thought
the box was lost to us, sure."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were impatient to have to-morrow
come because they wanted to see what the
German&mdash;they did not know what his true
name was&mdash;was going to do about it.</p>

<p>"I will tell you one thing, Jack," said
Julian. "If that Dutchman goes to-morrow
and sees Mr. Wiggins about it, he will get a
look that will last him as long as he lives. I
ought to know, for I have had those eyes
turned on me two or three times. If that
man stands against them I shall think he is a
nervy fellow."</p>

<p>The night wore away at last, and at the
usual hour the boys were at their posts. Casper
was in the office, and he seemed to be
uneasy about something. He could not sit
still. He was continually getting up and going
to the door, and then he would come back and
walk around the room. When Mr. Wiggins
came in and wished them all a good-morning,
Julian followed him into the back room.</p>

<p>"Julian, have you some news about that
box?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there was a man up to our room
and handed us this card, and I thought&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"Halloo," said Mr. Wiggins. "The box
does not belong to you, after all."</p>

<p>"Hold on until I get through explaining
things," said Julian.</p>

<p>With this Julian began, and told him of the
conversation that had taken place between
Jack and the German, not omitting the smallest
thing. Mr. Wiggins listened intently, and
when the story was done he said,</p>

<p>"Somebody has been posting that man in
regard to that box. Now, who have you told
about it except Jack Sheldon?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as that has anything to do
with it," said Julian, who resolved that he
would stand by Casper as long as he could.</p>

<p>"Yes, it has; it has a good deal to do with
it. Does Casper Nevins know all about it?"</p>

<p>"What do you know about Casper?" said
Julian in surprise. He wondered if there was
any boy in the office who could do anything
wrong without Mr. Wiggins finding it out.</p>

<p>"Because he has been uneasy for the past
week. Does Casper know all about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he does. He was there when we
read the letter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all. I will see you again after a
while."</p>

<p>Julian went out and sat down, and in a few
minutes Mr. Wiggins came from the back
room and spoke to the operator, who immediately
sent off a dispatch. Nobody was
called to carry this, for the message went
straight to the office for which it was intended.
Five minutes passed, and then a
stout man, who was a stranger to all of them,
strolled into the office. One of the boys got
up to wait upon him, pushing some blanks
toward him, but the stout man did not want
to send any telegraphic dispatches.</p>

<p>"I just want to look around and see how
you do things here," said he.</p>

<p>"Then take this chair, sir," said Mr. Wiggins.
"I guess you will find that we do
things about right."</p>

<p>The minutes passed, and all the boys who
had congregated in the office had been sent
off with messages&mdash;all except Casper. There
did not seem to be any dispatches for him.
The chief operator was busy at his desk, when
suddenly the door opened, and the same German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
who had called at Julian's room the
night before, came in. Mr. Wiggins glanced
toward him and then he looked toward Casper.
The latter never could control himself
when he was in difficulty, and his face grew
white.</p>

<p>"Is this the Western Union Telegraph
office?" said the German, wiping his forehead
with his handkerchief. "Do I speak to Mr.
Wiggins? Well, sir, I would like to see you
about a box that one of your boys bought at
a sale of 'old horse' in the express office.
That box contains something that is off immense
value to me&mdash;S. W. Haberstro." And
he handed out his card with his name engraved
on it.</p>

<p>"There is a box here addressed to a man
of that name," said Mr. Wiggins, "but it is
in the bank now. I suppose you have plenty
of friends here to whom you can refer?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that I have not," replied
the German. "My home is in Chicago.
I can refer you to all the Germans there."</p>

<p>"Then, would it not be worth while for
you to write to some of your friends there and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
get some letters of recommendation? You
see, we don't want to give the box to anybody
unless we know who it is."</p>

<p>"That is all right, sir. I have some business
on hand in Chicago, and I will go up
there and get them."</p>

<p>"That will be sufficient. Good-day, sir."</p>

<p>The German, who appeared to be in a great
hurry, closed the door and hastened up the
street. As soon as he was gone, Mr. Wiggins
beckoned to Casper and went into the back
room.</p>

<p>"Who was that man who just went out?"
said he, in a tone of voice which did not admit
of argument. "Tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"His name is Claus, sir," said Casper.</p>

<p>"Where does he stay, principally?"</p>

<p>"He stays first in one pool-room, and then
in another. Where he lives I don't know."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Mr. Wiggins.</p>

<p>"I never have been guilty of such a thing
before," began Casper.</p>

<p>"I said that would do," interrupted Mr.
Wiggins. "I may see you again after a
while."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>When Mr. Wiggins and Casper got out
into the other room they found that the stout
man had disappeared. He had gone out
about the time that the German disappeared.
In half an hour he came back, leaned over
the desk, and spoke to the chief operator.</p>

<p>"That fellow is no more Haberstro than I
am," he whispered. "His name is Solomon
Claus. We have had him up a time or two
for vagrancy, and I'll take him up for the
same cause, if you say so."</p>

<p>"No; let him go, but keep your eyes on
him. He has not done us any harm yet.
If he comes here again I will send for you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CLAUS CALLS AGAIN.</h3>

<p>When the stout man reached the sidewalk
he saw the German a short distance
in advance of him, still hurrying along
as though he had no time to waste. He
turned several corners, and at last disappeared
up the stairs that led to the pool-room. The
detective, for that was what he was, did not
seem to notice what had become of the German,
but he marked the place where he had
gone up and kept on to the station-house.
There he changed his coat and hat, and
picked up a huge walking-stick which stood
in one corner. When he came out on the
streets again, everybody noticed that he
walked with difficulty, and there was an expression
on his face which only those who
were intimate with the detective would have
thought belonged to him. It was very different
from his ordinary appearance. Instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of the frank, open look with which he regarded
everybody, it was drawn up as though
he was suffering intense pain, from which he
could not get a moment's relief.</p>

<p>The detective speedily found the place
where the German had disappeared, walked
wearily up the stairs, opened the door, and
sank into the nearest chair. Then he pulled
a pair of eye-glasses from his pocket and became
interested in a paper. But he used his
eyes to some advantage, and quickly discovered
the man he wanted seated off by himself,
with his legs outstretched before him and his
chin resting on his breast.</p>

<p>"I guess he found some difficulty in getting
that box," said the detective, who knew what
Mr. Wiggins wanted of him before he came
to the office. "You want to go easy, my
friend, or I'll have you up for vagrancy
again."</p>

<p>There were not so many in the pool-room
as there were the night before, and nobody
seemed to bother the German; but presently,
while he was thinking about it, another party
came in. He took off his coat, seized a cue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
and looked all around the room for an antagonist,
until he discovered the German sitting
there doing nothing.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Claus!" he shouted, "come on,
and let us have a game of billiards."</p>

<p>"No, you must excuse me," was the reply;
"I don't feel in the humor for billiards or
anything else."</p>

<p>"Have you anybody on a string that you
are trying to make some money out of?"
asked his friend. "Come on, and perhaps a
game will brighten you up."</p>

<p>"'Claus,'" muttered the detective. "I
know you now. I was told to find out what
his name was, so I will go back. So this is
where you hang out. I will remember you."</p>

<p>The detective hobbled out the door and
down the stairs; but by the time he got down
to the street his lameness had all disappeared,
and he walked as briskly as anybody. He
went to the Western Union Telegraph office,
told Mr. Wiggins he had discovered that the
man's name was Claus, and not Haberstro,
and then went back to the station. Casper
Nevins was called into the back room a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
afterward, but he was not there more
than long enough to receive his discharge.</p>

<p>"I have never done anything like this before,"
said Casper, trying to beg off. "If you
will overlook this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't do it," said Mr. Wiggins. "You
are a boy that I can't trust. Why, Casper,
do you know what will become of you if you
do not mend your ways? You will get into
the State's prison before you are five years
older. I paid you up yesterday, and you
have not done anything to-day, and so you
can go."</p>

<p>"It would not be of any use for me to ask
for a letter of recommendation, would it?"
asked Casper. He always had a good deal of
audacity about him, but this made Mr. Wiggins
open his eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>"Not from me, you can't," he answered.
"You will have to go somewhere else to get
it."</p>

<p>Casper put on his cap and left the office,
and on the way to the pool-room, where he
expected to find Claus, he blamed everybody
but himself for the disgrace he had got into.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
He blamed Claus, although it is hard to see
what that man had done, for he worked as
hard as anybody could to get that box; but
he reproached Julian Gray more than all for
his interference in the matter.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, I don't know but I
am to blame a little myself," said he, after he
had thought the affair all over. "Why did I
not dig out the moment I got that box? I
would have been in Denver by this time, and
enjoying my wealth. It beats the world what
luck some people do have."</p>

<p>But Claus was not in the pool-room. He
wanted to be alone, so that he could think
over the matter, and he had gone out where
he would be by himself. The barkeeper did
not know where he had gone, and Casper
went home to change his clothes. As he
pulled his uniform off he told himself that it
would be a long time before he ever wore it
again. Then he threw himself into a chair
and tried to determine what he should do
next.</p>

<p>"I have just ten dollars," he mused, taking
the bill from his pocket, "and what I shall do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
when that is gone is another and a deeper
question. I'll bet that Claus don't get any
cigars out of me to-night."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Julian Gray came in from delivering
his message. His face was flushed,
and he acted as though he had been running.
He made his report, and then went into the
back room in obedience to a sign from Mr.
Wiggins.</p>

<p>"Well, Julian, your box is still safe," said
the latter.</p>

<p>"Has that Dutchman been around here?"
asked Julian.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiggins said he had, and then went
on to give the boy a complete history of what
Claus had done to secure the box.</p>

<p>"I got rid of him very easily," said Mr.
Wiggins. "I told him that it would be well
for him to write to some German friends in
Chicago, where he said he lived, and he said
he was going up there on business and would
bring the letters back with him. I found out
that his name is Claus, and that he hangs out
in a pool-room. You don't know him, do
you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>No, Julian could not say that he had ever
heard of him before.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you let the box go without
seeing me about it."</p>

<p>"Nobody shall have it. Mr. Wiggins, I
don't know how to thank you for what you
have done."</p>

<p>"You are a good boy, Julian, and the only
thing I have against you is that you will hang
around that express office so much. Some
day I am going to give you a good scolding
for that."</p>

<p>"You will never hear of my being there
again. I am done going there forever."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will have to do it any
more. You have your fortune, easy enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Wiggins! Do you think it is
ours sure enough?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I ought not to speak so
positively; it is hard to tell at this stage of the
game. I <i>hope</i> you have."</p>

<p>Julian was delighted to hear Mr. Wiggins
talk in this way, but before he could ask him
any more questions that gentleman had gone
back into the office. He then went out and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
looked around for Casper. One of the boys
told him he believed Casper had got the
"sack," for he put on his cap and left the
office.</p>

<p>"I don't know what he has been doing,"
said the boy; "do you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wiggins knows, and he will not tell,"
replied Julian. "I wonder what the poor
fellow will do now?"</p>

<p>Julian was impatient for night to come, so
that he could go home and see Jack about it.
It came at last, and Julian never broke a trot
until he ran up the stairs and burst into his
room.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Jack. "You look happy.
Tell us all about that Dutchman."</p>

<p>"There is not much to tell. His name is
Claus, and he lives in a pool-room."</p>

<p>"I knew I was not mistaken in him," said
Jack, taking his usual seat by throwing his
leg over the table. "That man had better go
somewhere else."</p>

<p>But that he did not feel inclined to go
somewhere else just then was evident, for just
as Jack pronounced his name the boys heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
his step coming up the stairs. He had a peculiar
step, which, once heard, could not be
forgotten.</p>

<p>"Well, he is coming again," said Julian.
"Now, what are you going to say to him?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon what he has to say to
me," said Jack. "Go to the door, let him in,
and put out a chair for him."</p>

<p>He rapped on the door the minute he got
there, and Julian opened it for him. He
looked closely from one to the other of the
boys, but did not see anything in their faces
to make him hide what he had on his mind.
He had a new plan, but it did not promise as
well as the one which had been defeated by
Mr. Wiggins. He wanted to induce one of
them to get the box for him and let him read
the papers that were in it. If he could prevail
upon them to bring the box out of the
bank, he was certain that in some way he
could get an opportunity to steal it. He did
not intend to go about it slyly; he intended
to take it, open and above-board, and let Jack
and Julian help themselves if they could.
He was certain that a revolver, presented at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
their heads and cocked, would surely keep
them quiet until he had locked the door and
got into the street. Where he would go after
that he neither knew nor cared. What he
wanted was to get possession of the box.</p>

<p>"Ah! Good-evening," said Claus, bowing
very politely. "I came back to see you
about that box."</p>

<p>"Take a chair," said Jack. "What about
the box?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wiggins said it was in the bank,"
said Claus, "and I want to know if you could
get it out of there and let me read the letter
and the papers. You see, the thing may not
be for me, and I don't want to go home and
bother my friends about it until I know what
the box contains."</p>

<p>"Oh! your friends won't care anything
about that," said Jack. "You tell them that
the box is for you, and they will give you all
the letters you want. Besides, I don't think
Mr. Wiggins would agree to what you ask."</p>

<p>The German did not like the way Julian
was acting. He had kept his eyes roaming
from one to the other; but, although the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
occupied his favorite position, with his hands
buried in his pockets and his feet spread out,
his expression was different from what it had
been the night before. There was a smile on
his face, and it would not have taken very
much to set him to laughing outright. Claus
began to think there was something up.</p>

<p>"Why, the box is your own, ain't it?"
asked Claus. "You can do what you please
with it."</p>

<p>"Not now, we can't. We have told Mr.
Wiggins that we wanted him to watch over it
for us, and he will have to be present when
you read the papers."</p>

<p>"Then you can't get it for me?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe I could, Mr. Claus.
You don't need anybody to give you a recommend.
Go to some of your friends here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Claus! Claus! That is not my name.
My name is Haberstro."</p>

<p>Julian grinned broadly, and even Jack did
not appear to be above merriment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by applying that
name to me?" exclaimed Claus. "There is
my card."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want to see it. I have one already.
Your name is Claus, you live in a billiard
saloon, and you got a full history of this box
from Casper Nevins."</p>

<p>"Young man, I will have you arrested before
you are an hour older!" said Claus, getting
upon his feet. "I come here and ask a
civil question of you, and you insult me!"</p>

<p>"Do so, and we will have Casper arrested
for burglary and you for trying to obtain
money under false pretenses. The sooner
you get about it the better it will suit us."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;I will have a policeman here
in less than ten minutes!"</p>

<p>Mr. Claus went out, and this time he did
not bow himself through the door as he had
done the night before. The boys heard him
going downstairs, and then turned and looked
at each other.</p>

<p>"Somebody has been posting those fellows,"
said Claus, as he hurried away toward
Casper's room. "I wonder if there was a detective
in there while I was at the office?
Two attempts have failed, but the third is
always successful."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>Claus was almost beside himself with fury,
but he retained his wits sufficiently to guide
him on the road to Casper's room. He found
the boy in, seated in a chair, with his elbows
on his knees, trying his best to make up his
mind what he was going to do, now that he
had been discharged from the telegraph office.
He had sat that way ever since eleven o'clock
in the forenoon, and had not been able to determine
upon anything. The first intimation
he had that anybody was coming was when
the door was thrown open and Claus came in,
muttering something under his breath that
sounded a good deal like oaths.</p>

<p>"There is no need that you should say anything,"
said Casper. "You have failed."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have; failed utterly and plump,"
said Claus.</p>

<p>"And I have been discharged."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Claus. "You are in a
fix, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I don't know what I shall do
now. Tell me your story, and I will tell you
mine."</p>

<p>"Have you a cigar handy?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"No; and I have no money."</p>

<p>"How long before you will be paid?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be two weeks yet."</p>

<p>"Then I will have to go down and get
some cigars myself. I can think more clearly
while my jaws are puffing than I can without."</p>

<p>"You got your last cigar out of me, old
fellow," said Casper to himself, when Claus
had left the room. "I have but little money,
and I am going to keep it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE MASTER MECHANIC.</h3>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you think of that?"
said Julian, when he was certain
that Claus had gone down the stairs and out
on the street. "He had better try some other
way of getting that box."</p>

<p>"He has failed," said Jack, putting a frying-pan
filled with bacon on the stove. "Casper
Nevins is at the bottom of that. I tell
you, that money is safe yet."</p>

<p>"Do you know that I looked upon it as
gone when he first came here and handed out
his card?" said Julian. "I thought he was
Haberstro, sure enough."</p>

<p>"I confess that I thought so, too. Now let
us go on and get supper. The next time we
save that money, somebody else will have a
hand in it."</p>

<p>"Why, will we have to fight for it?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way to me now. We don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
know anything about business, and the first
thing we know we'll get tripped up."</p>

<p>"I did not think of that," said Julian,
drawing a long breath. "I wish Mr. Wiggins
were going out to Denver with us. I
will get advice from him before we start."</p>

<p>"We have not got out there yet," said
Jack, with a laugh. "If we do get there, we
will go to the lawyer who drew up those
deeds. He must be an honest man."</p>

<p>The boys continued to talk in this way
until the room was swept up and the dishes
washed, and when bedtime came they went
to sleep. The next morning found them on
duty again. Casper was not there to greet
him and make inquiries concerning the box,
but there were other boys there who wanted
to know why Casper had been discharged.
They appealed to Julian, for he was in the
back room shortly before; but he thought the
best thing he could do was to keep a still
tongue in his head.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wiggins knows why he discharged
Casper, and if he won't tell you, I don't know
where else you can apply."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"You had a hand in it and I know it,"
said one boy who was enough like Casper to
have been his brother. "Maybe you are a
spy on us."</p>

<p>"You come out in the back yard and I'll
show you who is a spy!" said Julian, rising
to his feet. "No one ever accused me of that
before. If I am a spy, you want to do your
duty right up to the handle."</p>

<p>This was something new on Julian, for we
know how hard he worked to keep the police
off from Casper's track. Some of the other
boys turned away as if they were quite willing
to believe that Julian was seeking for
promotion, while some others stood up close
to him, as if to assure him of their protection.</p>

<p>"If you will stay by me when Mr. Wiggins
comes here, I will ask him before you if I had
anything to do with Casper's discharge. He
will tell you the truth."</p>

<p>But the boys wisely appealed to him not to
do that. Since Casper had been discharged,
they wanted their skirts clear of him, and the
best way to do that would be to say nothing
about it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Julian, you want to keep clear of
that fellow who called you a spy," said one of
the boys. "He has been jealous of you for a
long time, in fact ever since the day you came
into the office, and just as soon as he gets a
good chance he is going to split on you."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I did not suppose I had an
enemy in this city. Let him keep watch, if
he wants to. My conduct will bear investigation."</p>

<p>Julian did not do his work with his usual
energy that day, for he could not bear to
think that one boy was acting as a spy upon
him. He carried his dispatches as well as he
could, never stopping to gaze in at the prize
windows or to make one of a crowd who gathered
around some show that had stopped for
a moment on a corner, and that was as well as
anybody could do. Jack laughed loudly
when he saw what a gloomy face Julian had
on when he told him of the matter.</p>

<p>"What do you care for spies?" said Jack.
"Do your duty faithfully, and then you will
be all right. In our place we don't have any
such things. The boys are always glad to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
see me promoted, for they think they have a
new mechanic to assist them when they get
into trouble."</p>

<p>For another month things moved along in
their usual way, and nothing was heard from
Mr. Haberstro. Julian did not meet Casper
or Claus, for they had disappeared completely.
He held frequent and earnest consultations
with Mr. Wiggins on the subject of the box,
put other advertisements in the papers, and
finally Mr. Wiggins took Julian down to the
bank and talked to the president. It excited
Julian wonderfully to know that the box was
theirs.</p>

<p>"I should not wait any longer, if I were in
your place," said the president. "You have
done all that you can to find the owner, and
he does not make his appearance. You can
go out there and lay claim to the property,
and enjoy it; and if at any time this Mr.
Haberstro turns up, you can give the property
over to him. But I want you to be careful
in what you are doing. There are plenty
of Haberstros in the world who would like
nothing better than to get that box."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"By George, Jack," said Julian, when he
went home that night, "did I not tell you
that that box was ours? I have talked with
the president of the bank about it, and he
says we can go out there and enjoy that property."</p>

<p>Jack took his usual seat, with his leg
thrown over the table, and looked at Julian
without speaking. He had never laid great
stress on having that box. He supposed that
Haberstro would show himself in due time,
and all they would have to do would be to
give up the money and go on with their work.
His good fortune was a little too much for
him to take in all at once. A dollar a day
was pretty big wages for him, and he supposed
that it would last till he learned his
trade, and that then he would receive more
money. But a hundred thousand dollars, to
say nothing of the gold-mine! Why, that
mine had already yielded its owner fifty thousand
dollars!</p>

<p>"Jack, why don't you say something?"
exclaimed Julian. "You don't act as though
you were a bit pleased. I wish, now, that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
had been a mile away when that box was put
up for sale."</p>

<p>Jack roared. He was always ready to
laugh when Julian talked in this way.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you <i>were</i> there when it
was sold," said he; "but the idea of owning so
much money rather takes my breath away. I
was just wondering what we would do if some
more Haberstros came up and demanded the
money. I suppose there are some men like
that in Denver, as well as there are here."</p>

<p>"The president cautioned me about that.
He told me to be careful in what we did.
Now, Jack, when will we start?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I shall have to see the
master mechanic about that. You know that
I am as deeply indebted to him as you are to
Mr. Wiggins."</p>

<p>"Does he know about the box?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. I thought I had better see
you about that before I broached the subject
to him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell it to him to-morrow. We
don't want to be any longer in getting out
there than we can help. We want to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
there before the snow flies, or the first thing
we know we'll be snowed up."</p>

<p>"Are you going to see Mr. Wiggins about
it?"</p>

<p>"I am. Let us go out to Denver at once."</p>

<p>"I tell you it comes hard to say good-bye
to those fellows; I have been with them so
long that I hate to do it. If I get in trouble
in any way, they will always help me out."</p>

<p>The next day Julian talked to Mr. Wiggins
about going out to Denver, and the latter's
face grew grave at once. He could not
bear to let Julian go out there among strangers.
He had always had him under his eye,
was waiting for a chance to promote him, and
now he was going away.</p>

<p>"I will go down and get the box," said he.
"And remember one thing, Julian: You may
get into a hard row of stumps out there, and
I want you to write to me fully and plainly
of what you are doing. If you want some
money, say so; and if you want to come back
here in the office, say that also, and I will try
and make room for you."</p>

<p>Julian's eyes filled with tears when he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Mr. Wiggins go out on the street and turn
toward the bank. He found, with Jack, that
it was going to be hard work to say good-bye.
When he went out into the other room, the
boys noticed at once that he had been crying.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the boy who had once accused
him of being a spy, "you have come up
with a round turn, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Julian, "I've got it at last."</p>

<p>"It serves you right!" said the boy. "If
Wiggins gave it to you in pretty good order
I shall be satisfied. You know now how
Casper felt when he was discharged."</p>

<p>"Are you discharged, Julian?" whispered
another of the boys.</p>

<p>"I guess I have got something like it," was
the reply; "you won't see me here to-morrow."</p>

<p>Julian walked to the window and looked
out on the street, and in a few minutes Mr.
Wiggins came up with the box. The boy
followed him into the back room, all the boys,
of whom there were half a dozen in the office,
looking on with surprise. Mr. Wiggins's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
face was grave, but he was not angry, and
they did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>"I think I would do this up and send it by
express&mdash;wouldn't you?" said he. "If this
is put in your trunk, and the cars run off the
track and get smashed, your trunk might get
smashed, too, and the box with it. Before I
put the cover on I will write a letter to our
agent in Denver. I have never seen him, but
that won't matter; and then, if you want any
good advice, go to him. Come in in the
course of half an hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" said Julian, emphatically; "I
am going to do my duty as long as I stay in
the office."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead; I will give you the box,
sealed and addressed to yourself, to-night."</p>

<p>Julian went out and took his seat among
the boys, and about half of them felt a little
bit sorry for him, but the other half did not.
Here was one favorite out of the way, and
consequently there was a chance for somebody
else. Presently his name was called,
and then Julian went away to deliver his
dispatch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>When six o'clock came, Julian went into
the back room and received the package.</p>

<p>"You will be around here before you go?"
said Mr. Wiggins, extending his hand.
"Then I won't bid you good-bye. Take this
box to the express office and send it off.
Have you any money?"</p>

<p>Yes, Julian had plenty of money. Did Mr.
Wiggins suppose that he was going to spend
all his month's wages in two days? He took
the box and went out, and took his way
toward the express office, wondering what the
clerk would say if he knew what was in that
package. The clerk turned out to be the
same one who had given him the box, but he
said nothing about it; and when Julian had
paid the express charges on it he came out
and started for home. As he was going up
the stairs he heard the sound of voices in the
room, and opened the door to find a man
there, dressed in his best, and with a very
smiling face, which he turned toward Julian.</p>

<p>"So this is the boy who bought himself
rich," said he, getting on his feet "I know
you from the description I have received of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
your uniform. I congratulate you heartily,
but I am sorry you are going to take Jack
away from me. When you are awful home-sick,
and are short of money, you can write to
me, and I will send you something to come
home on."</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Dawson, our master mechanic,"
said Jack.</p>

<p>"I am glad to meet you, Mr. Dawson," said
Julian, shaking the man's hand very cordially.
"Jack often found fault with me for going to
that office, but I struck it once,&mdash;didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say you <i>did</i>," returned
Mr. Dawson, with a laugh; "you couldn't do
it again if you were to try it your lifetime."</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir; we will have supper ready
after awhile, and you must join us."</p>

<p>"That's just what I came up here for. Jack
is going away pretty shortly, and I shall not
see him any more, so I came up to be with
him as long as I could."</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson moved back his chair so that
he would not be in the way, and Julian
pulled off his coat and went to work; but he
saw by the extra bundles there were on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
table that his chum had been going back on
his principles. There were cream cakes and
peaches by the dozen, as well as sundry other
little things that Jack had purchased for supper.
It was a better meal than they had been
accustomed to for a long time, and if there
was any faith in the way that master mechanic
asked for peaches, he thoroughly enjoyed
it.</p>

<p>"I hope you boys will live this way while
you are gone," said he, as he pushed back his
chair and declined having any more. "You
must remember that a hundred thousand
dollars don't go very far. There certainly is
an end to it, and the first thing you know
you'll be there. Now, I hope you fellows
won't object if I smoke a cigar?"</p>

<p>The "fellows" did not object, nor did he
raise any complaint when they proceeded to
wash the dishes. It was eleven o'clock when
Mr. Dawson said it was time he was going
home, and when the boys felt the hearty
grasp of his hand at parting, they told themselves
that there was one friend they were
leaving behind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>WHERE ARE THE VALISES?</h3>

<p>For the next two days Julian did not know
whether he stood on his head or heels.
Jack went about his preparations very moderately,
but the fact of it was, Julian was in a
great hurry. He could not help telling himself
that if they did not get away from St.
Louis, that man Haberstro would appear just
at the wrong time, and they would have to go
back to work again. He donned a citizen's
dress and tied his uniform up neatly in a
bundle, calculating to take it down to the
office and present it to a boy there who did
not act as though he had more in this world
than the law allows.</p>

<p>"I will give this up to Hank," said he.
"The poor fellow don't have any too much,
and perhaps this suit will help him."</p>

<p>Jack accompanied him to the office&mdash;it was
the first time he had ever been there&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
while he was looking around to see how they
did business, Julian found the boy of whom
he was in search.</p>

<p>"Here's a present I have brought for you,
Hank," said he in a whisper. "You asked
me yesterday if I had been discharged, and
that showed that you were a friend of mine.
I told you the truth; I have been discharged,
and I am going out to Denver. This is my
uniform. Take it and wear it, and think of
me."</p>

<p>Julian did not wait for the boy to raise any
protests, but laid the bundle down on his
seat, and then turned toward Mr. Wiggins.</p>

<p>"I haven't gone yet," said he. "We are
going to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Well, come in and say good-bye before
you go," said Mr. Wiggins.</p>

<p>Julian took the opportunity to introduce
Jack, who raised his cap respectfully. He
listened while Mr. Wiggins congratulated him
on his good fortune, and heard some very
good advice in regard to saving his money.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, Julian," said he,
when they had left the office behind them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
"everybody who is anybody is glad that we
are going to improve ourselves, and many
seem to think there is going to be an end to
that hundred thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you that it don't come to an end
with <i>me</i>," said Julian, emphatically. "I am
going to purchase some things that I need,
but I shan't touch the principal at all."</p>

<p>The first thing was to go to a store and buy
a trunk. Up to this time they had never had
any receptacle for their clothes, carrying all
their belongings in a traveling-bag. They
concluded that one trunk was enough, and,
after they had purchased it, Jack shouldered
it and was going to take it home.</p>

<p>"Come, now, that won't do," whispered
Julian; "it is three miles to our room."</p>

<p>"No matter if it is a thousand," said Jack;
"I can take it there."</p>

<p>"Put it down, and I will get a carriage."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't pay for it."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i>; I don't see what's the use in our
being so particular."</p>

<p>Jack put the trunk down, and Julian went
out, and very soon returned with a carriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
The boys held a consultation, and decided
that, now that they had a conveyance, they
might as well stop at some places on the way
home and invest in some other articles they
needed.</p>

<p>"But I'll tell you one thing," said Jack;
"you are keeping this rig too long; I won't
pay for it."</p>

<p>It was three hours before the friends got
home, and then they had their trunk more
than half-filled with new clothing. The
hackman carried it upstairs for them, and
Julian, having paid him his price, threw himself
into a chair to wait until Jack did the
packing. In addition to the trunk, the boys
bought small traveling-bags, in which they
carried several handy little articles they
thought they might need during their journey,
such as towels, comb and brush; and
Julian stowed away in his a book that he had
long desired to possess&mdash;"The Last Chronicle
of Barset," by Anthony Trollope. Jack
could hardly conceal his disgust; he was
going to look out of the window when they
were fairly on the train, and he would see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
more fun in that than Julian could in reading
his book.</p>

<p>"There, sir, I guess it's all done," said
Jack, going to the closet to make sure that
they had left nothing behind.</p>

<p>"All right; lock the trunk and put the
key in your pocket," said Julian. "Now
give me half of what this room will come to
during the present month, and I will go down
and pay the landlady. We haven't anything
to eat, so I guess we will have to go down to
a restaurant and get dinner and supper all in
one."</p>

<p>"I think a sandwich and a cup of coffee
would go pretty well," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am going to have a better meal
than that. Where's the money?"</p>

<p>Jack counted out his share of the rent, and
Julian posted off to see the landlady. He
was gone a long time, but he came back with
a receipt in his hand which he showed Jack,
and then the two boys went out to get their
dinner. Jack ordered what he had said he
would; but anyone who could have seen what
Julian sent for would have thought he was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
millionaire already. Jack looked on but did
not say anything; he was old enough to know
that the change in Julian's circumstances
would make him reckless for a while. He
remarked that he might as well go down to
the shop and bid the fellows good-bye, and
then it would be done with; so they turned
their faces in that direction when they came
out, and in a short time they were among the
railroad shops. Jack knew where to go;
and, after leading his companion through a
long workshop, where Julian would certainly
have got in somebody's way if he had not
stuck close to his heels, finally ushered him
into the helpers' room. He shook hands with
them one after the other&mdash;dirty, begrimed
fellows they were, too, looking very unlike
the well-dressed men they were when dressed
up for Sundays&mdash;and presently he came to
the master mechanic. The latter threw his
arm around Jack, led him away out of earshot
of the others, and held an earnest conversation
with him. He even put his hand
into his pocket, but Jack shook his head and
turned away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, Julian; I guess I have said
good-bye to them all," said he, as he led the
way to the street. "Every one of those fellows
wanted to give me money&mdash;as if they
didn't know I have enough already. Well, I
hope the last one of them will be successful.
If they want any money, they can apply to
me."</p>

<p>Julian had never seen Jack look sad before.
After going a little way on the street,
Jack turned and looked at the shop as if he
thought he never would see it again. Julian
did not know that Jack had so much heart
in him.</p>

<p>The next day was devoted to Julian, who
went down to the office and took leave of all
his friends. Even the boy who had accused
him of being a spy came in for a good, hearty
hand-shake. He did not know how to take
it, but stammered out something about being
sorry he had treated Julian in the way he did.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the boy; "only, the
next time don't you accuse any boy of being
a spy on you unless you know whereof you
speak."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wiggins had something more to say to
Julian. He conducted him into the back
room, and kept him there until Jack began
to be impatient. When he came out again,
Julian was wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack," said he, when they
were well on their way to the railroad depot
to purchase their tickets, "when one has
been here and done the best he could in the
office, it comes hard to say good-bye. Every
boy&mdash;and man, too&mdash;has used me white, if I
except that fellow who accused me of being a
spy. But this isn't the last time we will see
St. Louis, I hope. When we get out to Denver,
and get fairly settled, we will come back
again."</p>

<p>The friends waited a long time at the depot,
for the ticket office was not open; but
they had much to talk about. What sort of a
looking place was Denver? They had not
read much about that, and they had somehow
got it into their heads that it was a little settlement,
and that they should find more wigwams
there than houses. But at last the
window was opened, and, falling in behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
the others, they purchased tickets which were
to carry them farther west than they had ever
been before.</p>

<p>"Now, the next thing is to get a sleeping-car,"
said Julian.</p>

<p>"We don't want a sleeping-car," said Jack,
catching Julian by the arm and leading him
away. "You can lie down on one seat, and I
can take the other, and we'll sleep just as
well there as we would on a pile of down."</p>

<p>Julian was obliged to give up, but told
himself that it would not always be so. He
wanted to spend money for something he
really needed, and he thought he could sleep
better in a sleeping-car than he could in
another which was devoted to passengers who
were wide awake.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained but to get their
supper and call a carriage to take them to the
depot. The boys took coffee and sandwiches,
and during the meal hardly spoke to one
another. That was the last meal they would
eat in St. Louis, and they wondered what the
future had in store for them. Perhaps, when
they got to Denver, they would find that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Haberstro had been there already, and by
some hook or crook had managed to get the
property into his own hands.</p>

<p>"But I don't see how that could be done,"
said Jack, when Julian hinted at this. "The
deeds are in Winkleman's name, and we have
them. How is he going to get the property,
then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I am afraid he will get
it some way."</p>

<p>"If he does, all we have to do is to give it
up."</p>

<p>But this was going to be a hard job, in
Julian's estimation. He did not confess that
much, but it would be disastrous to him to
have to surrender those blocks of buildings.
He thought of it all that day, and while he
was seated in the cars, going with as much
speed as steam could put forth to carry him
to his destination, it still bothered him. The
master mechanic was there to bid them once
more a good-bye, and Julian was certain,
when he turned away and hung his head
down, that there were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>As long as daylight lasted, Julian was busy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
looking out of the window as they rushed
through the country; but when the lamps
were lighted he began to grow sleepy.</p>

<p>Julian was sitting on one bench, and Jack,
having turned his seat over, was sitting on
the other, and, having arranged their beds,
they lay down on them; but it was a long
time before they fell asleep.</p>

<p>"Now, you see, if we had a sleeping-car we
wouldn't have to go to all this trouble," said
Julian.</p>

<p>"Wait until you get too tired to keep your
eyes open, and you won't know whether we
are in a sleeping-car or not," said Jack; "I
am most ready to go off this minute."</p>

<p>Jack's words came out true, for after they
had given up their tickets and been furnished
with a slip to put in their caps, Julian speedily
lost himself in the land of dreams, and the
next thing he knew Jack was shaking him
by the shoulder. It was broad daylight, and
the train was still whirling them onward.</p>

<p>"Can we get anything to eat along here?"
said Julian, looking out of the window; "I
am hungry."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a place a few miles ahead, so I
heard the conductor tell a passenger, where
we will stop to get breakfast," said Jack.
"That was the reason I called you. If you
are anything like me, you can eat a whole pan
of baked beans."</p>

<p>"Baked beans!" said Julian. "They have
something better than that to eat on the railroad.
I am going to get a breakfast that is
worth the money."</p>

<p>There was another thing that bothered
Julian, and that was, he did not have any
place to wash; but Jack told him that that
would be remedied when they came to their
stopping-place. They rode on for a dozen
miles or so, and when the whistle sounded,
and the brakeman announced fifteen minutes
for breakfast, they left their valises in their
racks and moved up nearer the door.</p>

<p>"That wakes a fellow up," said Julian, as
he plunged his face into a basin of water.
"We have to hurry, Jack, for fifteen minutes
is not a great while."</p>

<p>The boys' breakfast was all that could be
asked, although, if the truth must be told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
they were not long in eating it. Julian
boarded the train first, and led the way along
to their seats; but where were the valises they
left there when they went out to breakfast?</p>

<p>"Is this our car?" said Julian, running his
eyes over the passengers.</p>

<p>"Why yes, this is our car," said Jack.
"There is that red-faced man who sat behind
you; he was sitting there when we left St.
Louis. But what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Matter enough; our valises are gone!"</p>

<p>"By George! So they are!"</p>

<p>"Say!" said the red-faced man, leaning
over the back of the seat. "I saw the man
who took those valises, but I supposed he was
a member of your party and that you had
sent him for them; therefore I did not stop
him."</p>

<p>"What sort of a looking man was he?"</p>

<p>"He was a very genteel fellow, but I noticed
that he toed in, and that he had a very
German cast of countenance."</p>

<p>"I wonder if it was Claus?" said Julian.</p>

<p>"I don't know what his name was, but he
got the valises. Say! If I were you I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
search the train, and if you find him you can
make him give your property up."</p>

<p>"We will do it. I wonder if we are ever
going to see the last of that man?"</p>

<p>The train had been gathering headway all
the while, and was now running at the rate
of thirty-five miles an hour. If Claus, or
whoever stole the valises, was on the train,
the boys were certain he could not jump off
to escape them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>IN DENVER.</h3>

<p>"Did the man find anything of value in
your valises?" asked the red-faced
man, as the boys turned toward the front part
of the car.</p>

<p>"He could have bought everything I had
in my valise for two dollars," said Jack, with
a laugh. "It seems funny that he should
want to put himself in danger of arrest for
that"</p>

<p>"He got a book in mine," said Julian.
"Of course I have read it before, but I
wanted to read it again. Say, Jack," he continued,
when the latter reached the door and
was about to open it, "if the man was Claus,
don't you suppose he had an eye on that
box?"</p>

<p>Jack released the door and leaned up
heavily against it. Such an idea had never
occurred to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"He watched us while we were in St. Louis,
and when he saw us ready to come out, he got
on the same train with us."</p>

<p>"What a lucky thing it was that we sent
that box off by express!" Jack almost gasped.
"Of course it was Claus, and we shall not find
him on this train, either. He jumped off at
that station back there."</p>

<p>"Let us go and see. If he is going to follow
us in this way, we are going to be in a
fix, the first thing you know."</p>

<p>Jack opened the door and went out, and
Julian followed close at his heels. They
went slowly through the cars, looking sharply
at every man they saw on the train, but nobody
with "a very German cast of countenance"
could be seen. The next thing was
to try the other end of the train. Jack led
the way, as before, and when they got into
their own car the red-faced man, who seemed
to take an interest in their success, said, in a
low tone,</p>

<p>"Did you find him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Jack; "he must have got
off at the station. We are going through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
sleeping-cars, and, if he is not there, we will
have to give him up."</p>

<p>In the next car there was no one who
looked like Claus, and when they opened the
door of the next car, and entered the vestibuled
part of the train, they found themselves
in an entry which was fitted up in the most
gorgeous manner. A negro porter stood in
front of the window looking out, and when he
saw who the boys were, he stepped up in front
of them.</p>

<p>"Does you want to see somebody on dis
train?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say we did," replied Jack.
"Some one has stolen our valises, and we want
to find him."</p>

<p>"Dat's bad. Has you got a ticket?"</p>

<p>"Of course we have. Don't you see the
slips in our caps?"</p>

<p>"But I mean a ticket for dis part of de
train. If you hasn't got one, you can't go
in."</p>

<p>This was a new arrangement to Jack. The
last time he travelled on the railroad it was
when the hands connected with the railroad-shop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
gave an excursion and a picnic, and
then he had no difficulty in going all over
the train; but he saw the beauty of it at once.</p>

<p>"Then we will have to give it up," said he,
turning toward the door. "That man may
be here and have our valises, and we can't
help ourselves."</p>

<p>"Mebbe not," said the negro. "What
kind of a looking man was he? I will go
over the train and look for him."</p>

<p>Jack described the man as well as he could
from the description the passenger had given
him, and the negro went out.</p>

<p>"Just see what we would have got we
had taken a sleeping-coach," whispered Julian.
"No one can come near you except
those who purchased tickets at the depot."</p>

<p>"We'll come to that after a while," said
Jack. "Wait until we get our money. Just
now it seems as though we shall have to be
constantly on the watch."</p>

<p>The negro was gone a long time, but our
friends found themselves busy in taking a
note of all their surroundings. There must
have been a good deal of money spent upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
that sleeping-car. There did not seem to be
a cheap thing about it. One or two passengers,
who had slept late and were just getting
up, came in, and yawned, and stretched, and
prepared to go through their ablutions. They
merely glanced at the two boys, and went on
with their work. They did not care for the
eating-stations that were scattered along the
route; when they were hungry, they could
go into the dining-coach and get all they
wanted.</p>

<p>"I tell you, it is worth while to know
where your money is coming from when you
travel," thought Julian; "one feels so much
safer."</p>

<p>By the time he had reached this conclusion
the negro appeared.</p>

<p>"Dar ain't a man on dis train that looks
like the one you spoke of," said he. "Dey's
all Americans; the last man-jack of them."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Jack. "Our man has
got off at the station. I hope he will get rich
on what he found in those valises."</p>

<p>The two friends went back to their own
car, and to the inquiry of the passenger who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
sat behind them replied that the man had
left the train as soon as he got the valises.
Then they settled down and prepared to enjoy
their journey; but it must be confessed that
Claus came into their minds very frequently.
If he was the one who took their valises, they
were certain that they had not seen the last
of him yet.</p>

<p>"And to think that that fellow watched us
all the while we were in St. Louis," said Jack,
leaning over and whispering the words to
Julian. "He may watch us after we get in
Denver. Who knows?"</p>

<p>But Claus, if that was the man, did not
come near them any more during their journey.
They grew weary, of course, and Julian,
having no book to read, slept most of
the way. Their night was passed in much
the same way that the first one was, and
about two o'clock in the morning they arrived
at Denver. The appearance of the
city, wrapped though it was in slumber, surprised
them. There were as many people
running about in the depot as there were in
St. Louis, and all appeared to have work to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
do. The man to whom they had given their
check was there to show them the way to
their omnibus, and Julian, while he was on
the way to it, looked all around for Indians,
but did not see any. The hotel was as large
as those they had left in St. Louis, and almost
before they knew it they were in their
room with two beds in it, the porter had carried
up their trunk, had bid them good-night,
and they were alone.</p>

<p>"Say, Jack, there's more houses than wigwams
here, is there not?"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking so myself," said Jack.
"Denver is a big city. Now, the next thing
is something else. It is something I don't
like to think of. That letter which Mr. Wiggins
wrote to the agent here may help us
some, but we have something to prove after
that."</p>

<p>"Well, don't let us worry about that to-night,"
said Julian. "Perhaps in the morning
it will look different."</p>

<p>Julian had never slept in so comfortable a
bed before, and when sleep overpowered him
he did not know a thing until he opened his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
eyes in the morning and saw Jack standing
at the window, with his suspenders about his
waist, looking through the window at some
mountains which seemed to be looming up
close at hand.</p>

<p>"When we get settled, if we ever do, we
must walk out there and take a view from the
top," said he.</p>

<p>"How far are they away from here?"</p>

<p>"About two or three miles, probably. I
believe if we get on the summit of those
mountains we can see California."</p>

<p>"I have just thought of another thing that
may bother us some," said Julian. "I don't
know whether the express clerks will want us
to identify ourselves before they give us that
box, but if they do&mdash;then what?"</p>

<p>"Although we are in the right, there is
always something to bother us," said Jack,
seating himself in the nearest chair. "What
will we do?"</p>

<p>"We can't do anything except to write to
St. Louis. There is nobody here that knows
us from Adam."</p>

<p>That was something that bothered Jack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
during breakfast, but at eight o'clock, the
hour when the express offices are generally
open, they were directed by the clerk how to
reach it, and in process of time drew up before
the counter. To Julian's inquiry if there
was a box there addressed to himself the clerk
placed the box before him, and never asked
him who he was or where he came from.</p>

<p>"Now, the next thing is to keep an eye out
for the telegraph office. If you see a sign
sticking out, let me know it."</p>

<p>"I see a sign already," said Jack, pointing
it out.</p>

<p>Julian began to feel a little more at home.
He had worked in a telegraph office, and he
was certain that he was going among friends.
The boys were there, and they came up to
wait on him, but Julian went ahead until he
confronted the operator at his desk.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Fay in?" Julian asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He is in his private office.
Would you like to see him?"</p>

<p>"I would thank you first to give me a
screw-driver so that I can take this cover off.
There is a letter in here addressed to him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>The screw-driver was soon forthcoming,
and while Julian was at work at it, a hustling
little man suddenly stood before him.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see me?" he asked, in a
business way.</p>

<p>Julian had by this time taken out the
letter, which was placed on top, and handed
it to Mr. Fay, who leaned against the counter
and read it. The boys watched him closely,
and finally saw his eyes light up with surprise.</p>

<p>"This letter has a stamp on it, so I know
it is all right," said he. "But this man Wiggins
I never heard of. Come into the office."</p>

<p>The boys followed him, seating themselves
in chairs that were pointed out to them, while
Mr. Fay went on reading the letter. He was
utterly amazed, and looked at the two friends
as if he could scarcely believe it.</p>

<p>"Which one of you boys is Julian Gray?"
he asked. "You are? Then I congratulate
you from the bottom of my heart. You
struck it rich once in buying 'old horse,'
didn't you? How long have you been with
Mr. Wiggins?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>Julian began, and told as much of his history
as he was willing that any stranger
should know&mdash;all except about pulling him
out from under the feet of the runaway horses.
He thought that that was a sacred matter between
him and Mr. Wiggins, and so he said
nothing about it.</p>

<p>"And how about your friend, here, John
Sheldon?" said he. "You see, I want to get
at the bottom of all your doings, so that I can
explain it to Mr. Gibson, Mr. Winkleman's
lawyer. We know of that man, and we know
why he left; but we want to be certain that
you have a right to the box."</p>

<p>Jack began and related his story; and although
Mr. Wiggins did not say much about
it, never having been acquainted with Jack,
the tale he told was so honest and truthful
that Mr. Fay could not but believe him.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I will go with you to see Mr.
Gibson," said the operator. "It all rests
with him. You see, all these things happened
eleven months ago, and he has collected considerable
money in rent for all these places.
You will come in for fifteen or twenty thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
dollars at the start. He may want to
ask you some questions."</p>

<p>What Mr. Fay said almost took the boys'
breath away. They had hardly anything in
their pockets, and to be told that they were
worth ten thousand dollars apiece was almost
too good for belief. They followed Mr. Fay
out on the street&mdash;the way he moved proved
that he had come up from the ranks&mdash;and up
the stairs that led to Mr. Gibson's office.
They found the lawyer in there, walking up
and down, but he stopped long enough to bid
Mr. Fay good-morning.</p>

<p>"What have these young men been doing?"
said he, pulling up a chair for each one to sit
down. "More lawsuits, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, sir, there is no law in this except
what you have a mind to tell us. Read this
letter; but first let me introduce the boys."</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson said he was glad to see them,
and then commenced the letter, and before he
had read it half-way through he whistled and
looked at them with intense surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you have done it, have you
not?" said he. "Now, whom have you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
prove that you bought this 'old horse' at the
express office?"</p>

<p>"Read on, sir, and I think the letter will
answer that question for you," replied Julian.
"I told Mr. Wiggins about it. That is all he
knows of it."</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson finished the letter at last, and
then turned and gave the boys a good looking
over. He evidently was not thinking about
them at all, but about some point of law that
had just occurred to him. Finally he said,</p>

<p>"I want you to understand that I believe
your story, but in order to be all right in
everything, and leave nothing for anybody to
pick a flaw with, I would like to know what
you did to look up this man Haberstro."</p>

<p>"If I were in your place, Gibson," said
Mr. Fay, "I would write to Mr. Wiggins and
the president of that bank, and get a full history
of the boys. They will tell the truth."</p>

<p>"Let me suggest to you, also, the name of
Mr. Dawson," said Jack. "I used to work
for him, and he knows all about me."</p>

<p>The lawyer took down the three addresses
of the men he wanted to write to.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you young fellows any money?"
asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a little."</p>

<p>"Will it last you two weeks?"</p>

<p>The two friends were sure it would last
them as long as that.</p>

<p>"Where are you stopping?"</p>

<p>Julian replied that they were stopping at
some hotel, but they did not know which one.</p>

<p>"Well, Fay will no doubt direct you to a
cheaper boarding-house than that. What are
you boys going to do with this?" said Mr.
Gibson, placing his hand upon the box.</p>

<p>"We want to put it somewhere so it will be
safe," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Shall I take charge of it for you? I will
put it in the bank. It is most too valuable
for me to carry around."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>After a little more conversation his two
clients went out. The lawyer sat for a long
time thinking the matter over, and at last he
got up, took the box under his arm and started
for the bank. He had decided that he would
go to St. Louis that very night.

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>CASPER NEVINS, THE SPY.</h3>

<p>"No, sir," said Casper, leaning over and
placing his elbows on his knees, his
eyes gazing thoughtfully at the floor; "you
don't get any more five cents out of me, yet
awhile, to pay for cigars. I have got only
ten dollars, and I am anxious to make that do.
Now, what shall I go at next?"</p>

<p>Casper Nevins was in a predicament the
first thing he knew. He claimed to be an
orphan, the same as Julian was; but those
who were well acquainted with his history
knew that he had a mother in a Western
village who was a dressmaker, and who would
have been glad to get every cent he could
send her. But Casper never sent her any
money. On the contrary, he often appealed
to her to forward him a few dimes, to pay his
debts for pool and cigars. Claus often got
into him a dollar or two on the games he lost,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and his mother was the only person he had to
call on. Now he had lost his position, and
the next thing was to find something else to
do. He was really afraid he would have to
go to work with his hands. He thought of
Jack Sheldon, dirty and begrimed as he was
when he came from the shop, and wondered
how he would look in that fix. And, another
thing, he wasn't satisfied that he could get as
good a position as Jack held. Aside from
being acquainted with the city and carrying
the telegraphic dispatches, there was nothing
else that he could do.</p>

<p>"I tell you I am up a stump," said Casper
to himself; "I shall soon be sweeping out
saloons, as Julian did, to pay for my breakfast.
I would rather die than do that."</p>

<p>When he had reached this point in his
meditations the door opened, and Claus came
in with a couple of cigars in his hand. He
did not seem to be at all worried over his
failure to get his hands upon that box, but he
was whistling a jig as he closed the door and
offered a cigar to Casper.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, any way?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
he asked, when he saw the gloomy look on
Casper's face. "You act as though you had
lost your last friend."</p>

<p>"What am I going to do now?" asked Casper.
"I have no trade, no profession, and I
must do something to keep myself in grub.
There is no pool or cigars for me from this
time on."</p>

<p>"Well, let that thing go until I tell you
my story," said Claus, who did not like to
hear a man talk in this way. He knew that
he was to blame for Casper's shortness of
funds&mdash;a good deal of his hard earnings was
located in Claus's own pockets&mdash;and he wanted
to make him look on the bright side of things
while he was in his presence. When he got
away where he could not see him, then he
could indulge in moody thoughts as often as
he pleased.</p>

<p>"I wish I had not played pool with you as
often as I have," said Casper, showing a little
spirit. "Every time I have crossed cues with
you I have always been out three or four
dollars. Why don't you play with somebody
else?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if you are going to talk that way
I'll go on," said Claus, getting up from his
chair. "What I was going to say was that I
don't believe that box is gone yet. I have
tried twice to get it and have failed; but there
is a charm in everything. Three times and
out is what I go by; but if you don't want to
hear what I have to say, why, good-night."</p>

<p>"Well, sit down," said Casper, who couldn't
bear to let Claus go away if he had anything
to say concerning that box; "but you yourself
would be angry if you were in my fix."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have been that way lots of times.
I have been so I didn't know where my next
meal was coming from."</p>

<p>"I have been that way, too," said Casper.
"The other night you got ten cents of me,
and it was the last cent I had in the world; I
had to get my next meal at the free-lunch
saloons."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were as hard up as
that," said Casper, with surprise. "Have
you money with which to get breakfast to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Not a cent."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"Then here are twenty cents," said Claus,
putting his hand into his pocket. "Two
meals will do you. In the meantime, if you
get hard up for something to eat, go to the
saloons; that's the way I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you always get something else.
If I go in there and dabble with their lunch,
the barkeeper will want to know why I don't
get something to drink."</p>

<p>"Then walk out and go to another saloon.
You ain't posted. Now, I want to tell you
my story. It isn't long, and I want to ask
you a question before I get through."</p>

<p>When Claus said this, Casper settled back
in his chair and tried to look interested; but
the trouble was, he only succeeded in looking
guilty.</p>

<p>"I have just come from Julian's room,"
continued Claus, "and I threatened him with
the police. He called me by my own name,
or Jack did, and I want to know who has
been telling him that. Did you?"</p>

<p>"I never said a word to him about you or
anybody else," said Casper, looking Claus
squarely in the eye.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you say anything to Mr. Wiggins
about it?"</p>

<p>"Never a word. There might have been a
detective in the office while you were there."</p>

<p>"A detective? Who was it?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know. But if he knew
your name, there was where he got it. You
went up to the pool-room after you got through
there? Well, did anybody follow you up to
see what your name was?"</p>

<p>"There was nobody up there that I saw,
and I took mighty good care to watch out. I
threatened him with the police for addressing
me by that name, and he just as good as told
me to go and get them."</p>

<p>"What made you say police at all? What
had he done?"</p>

<p>"I wanted him to get the box and let me
read the papers in it, because I wanted to be
sure that they were intended for me; but he
would not do it."</p>

<p>"Of course he would not!" exclaimed Casper,
in disgust. "That was a pretty way to
do business, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I calculated, if he brought the box in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
there, to steal it away from them," said Claus.
"If I once got out on the street, I would like
to see anybody catch me. I would have hung
around this city for a month but that I would
have got away with it."</p>

<p>"And what would I be doing in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"You would have known where I was,"
said Claus, bending toward Casper and speaking
in a whisper. "I would have found
means to communicate with you. Of course
if I had got that box you would have had a
share of it."</p>

<p>Casper did not know whether to believe
this or not. Somehow he had felt suspicious
of Claus ever since the first night he spoke to
him about the box. If the German got it
without any of his help, he was sure that he
never would see any of it.</p>

<p>"Well, you failed in that scheme, and I
would like to know if you have some other
means of getting hold of it."</p>

<p>"Certainly I have. Three times and out
is what I go by. My next scheme will be to
steal the box from them on the train."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you going to do that?"</p>

<p>"We will keep watch of them, and when
they are ready to go to Denver, we will go,
too. You know their habits better than I do,
and by keeping your eyes on them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I won't do it," said Casper, emphatically.
"They may not go for a month
yet, and I must have something to eat in the
meantime."</p>

<p>"I will give you twenty cents a day and
enough to pay your rent," said Claus. "That
will keep you going, won't it?"</p>

<p>"You must give me more than that. I
shall need a cigar once in a while, won't I?"</p>

<p>"Then I will give you thirty cents. You
don't want to smoke more than two cigars
every day, do you?"</p>

<p>The question where Claus earned the money
he had was a mystery to every one except
himself. When the police arrested him for
vagrancy and the justice fined him ten dollars,
believing that he was going to shut him
up for two months, Claus pulled out a roll of
greenbacks as large as one's wrist. The justice
gazed at him in surprise and said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>"I had no idea that you were so well
heeled as that."</p>

<p>"I have a relative in Europe who sends
me money once in a while," said Claus.</p>

<p>"Well, get out of here, and don't come into
this station any more."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Claus; "and I wouldn't
have come in here this time, only the police
brought me."</p>

<p>"You must go easy on me, because I haven't
too many ducats," said Claus, continuing the
conversation which we have broken off. "I
think thirty cents a day will see you through
in good fashion."</p>

<p>"Of course that puts a different look on the
matter. Begin by giving me ten cents to get
a cigar with to-night. Thank you. Now,
what do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"You are to begin and keep your eye on
Julian, and report to me every day at the
pool-room. Whenever you see preparations
made for them to go out to Denver, you must
let me know it; then we will go, too."</p>

<p>"But how are you going to steal their
valises, if they have any?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"They will leave their valises behind them
when they go out to get their meals, and I
will slip up and get them. You won't have
anything to do with stealing them at all."</p>

<p>"That is a bargain," said Casper. "I believe
that is the best way yet. But remember&mdash;you
must keep out of their sight; and I
will, too."</p>

<p>A little more conversation was held on the
subject, and then Claus took his leave. When
the door closed behind him Casper arose to
his feet, placed his thumb against his nose,
and wiggled his fingers. That was his opinion
of Mr. Claus's scheme.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean to do," said he,
in a voice that was choked with passion.
"You are going to get me out there on the
railroad and leave me. But I will see that
you don't do it; I will stick closer to you
than a brother, and when you get that box I
will be close at hand. Now I will go off to
some restaurant and get some supper."</p>

<p>The next morning dawned clear and bright,
and when Casper opened his eyes his first
thought was to get up; but remembering that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
he had not to go to the office that day, he
rolled over and dropped asleep again. But
he had to get up at last; and after a good,
hearty breakfast, and smoking a cigar, he
strolled down toward the telegraph office.
Julian was there, sitting in his chair, for he
could see him through the window. He had
not made preparations to go to Denver yet.
And so it was during every day that the boys
waited for Haberstro to show up. Julian was
as impatient as Casper, and even Claus began
to growl for fear there was being too big a
haul made upon his money.</p>

<p>"I am not an Astor, to be giving you
thirty cents a day to watch those fellows,"
said he. "If they don't begin to make some
move very soon I shall be sorry that I hired
you."</p>

<p>"They are going to Denver some time, and
if you are bound to have a hand in the box,
the best thing for you to do is to keep on hiring
me," said Casper. "I know what you
want," he added to himself. "If you were to
give me every cent of money you have, I
would just about get my own back."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>But not long after this, when Casper was
strolling by the telegraph office to see what
was going to happen, he saw Julian and Jack
go in there. The two boys were dressed in
citizens' clothes, too, and that proved that
there was something up. While he was wondering
whether or not he had better go back
and report the matter to Claus, Mr. Wiggins
came out and took his way toward the bank.
In a little while he came back again with the
box under his arm. Casper concluded to
wait still longer, and the result proved satisfactory.
The two friends came out of the
office, and Julian held the door open long
enough to say,</p>

<p>"I haven't gone yet; I will come back and
bid you good-bye before I start."</p>

<p>"By gracious, they are going!" said Casper,
so excited that he could not stand still.
"Now, the next thing is to find out <i>when</i> they
are going. I guess I will go and see what
Claus has to say about it."</p>

<p>Claus was found in the pool-room, and he
was playing a game with somebody. He
drew off on one side, and Casper hurriedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
related what he had to say to him. For a
wonder Claus smiled.</p>

<p>"They are going to-morrow night," said he.</p>

<p>"You talk as though you knew all about
it. How do you know?" asked Casper, with
the accent on the adverb.</p>

<p>"Because Julian has got his discharge, he
is dressed in citizen's clothes, and they will
have to take to-day in order to bid their
friends good-bye and get some things that are
necessary for the trip," said Claus. "Watch
them closely, and when you see a carriage
drive up to their door and a trunk put on,
come to me here and I will be ready for
you."</p>

<p>"How are you going to get your own luggage
down?" asked Casper.</p>

<p>"I don't want any luggage," replied Claus;
"I have more money than enough to buy&mdash;humph!"</p>

<p>He had intended saying that he had money
enough to buy all the clothing he wanted, but
seeing Casper's eyes fastened upon him he
caught his breath in time and said,</p>

<p>"I have money enough to pay for a night's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
lodging, and that is all we want. Now you
go and do just as I tell you."</p>

<p>Claus turned again to his game and Casper
went slowly out of the room. The German
watched him, as he opened the door, and said
to himself,</p>

<p>"I wonder if that fellow knows what I am
up to? He acts like it; but if he does, I
would like to see him help himself."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>GETTING READY FOR WORK.</h3>

<p>"I know just what you are going to do,"
repeated Casper, as he ran down the
stairs&mdash;"you are going to steal the box, and
leave me out on the prairie to get back the
best way I can. For two cents I would not
have anything to do with it."</p>

<p>But in spite of this resolution, Casper, as
soon as he reached the street, turned his gaze
in every direction in the hope of finding Julian
and Jack; but the boys had disappeared.
He walked along the streets looking everywhere
for them, and finally came to a standstill
opposite Julian's room.</p>

<p>"They will have to come here some time,
and I will just take my stand here in this
door and watch for them," said Casper.
"They will not take that box with them,
anyhow; it is much too valuable to lug about
in a valise. They will send it by express."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>This was something that had occurred to
Casper on the spur of the moment, and he
thought seriously of going back to Claus with
it; but, on the whole, he decided to keep still
about it. He was getting thirty cents a day
for doing nothing, and he did not want to
bring that to an end too speedily. Claus had
plenty of money. Casper had seen the inside
of his pocketbook when he took it out to pay
him his money, and he might as well have
thirty cents of it as not.</p>

<p>At the end of three hours Casper saw the
carriage coming up the street. He was certain
that he was right in his suspicions, because
carriages of that description were not
often seen in that by-street; and, more than
that, there was a trunk perched in front of
the driver. He drew up in front of Julian's
room, and a moment afterward the boys got
out. Casper saw the driver catch up the
trunk and carry it upstairs, and presently he
came down again, mounted to his box, and
disappeared up the street.</p>

<p>"They are gentlemen now, and of course
they could not carry that trunk upstairs,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
sneered Casper, coming out of his concealment.
"Now, I wish I knew when they are
going to start. If things were all right between
Julian and myself I would go upstairs
and find out; but as it is, I guess I had better
keep away; he would not tell me, anyhow. I
stole that box from him once, and that was
where I missed it. I ought to have gone to
Denver at once."</p>

<p>After some time spent in rapid walking,
Casper once more found himself in the pool-room,
and saw Claus busy with his game.
Claus drew off on one side, while Casper
whispered the result of his investigations to
him.</p>

<p>"That is all right," said he, and a smile
overspread his face. "You are much better
at watching than I thought you were. Wait
until I get through here and I will give you
a cigar."</p>

<p>"But, Claus, though they had a valise
apiece in their hands, they have no idea of
carrying the box in them," said Casper; "it
is too valuable."</p>

<p>"That's the very reason they will take it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
with them," whispered Claus. "They will
not trust it out of their sight."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you that they will send it by express,"
answered Casper; "that is what I
should do with it."</p>

<p>"But all persons are not as careful as you
are," said Claus; and he turned to take his
shot at the game.</p>

<p>"You need not think you can soft-sawder
me in that style," thought Casper, as he
backed toward a chair and took his seat to
see how the game was coming out. "You
have some other little trick that you want me
to play. Well, if it is not too dangerous I'll
do it; if it is, I won't."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more that we can do to-night,
but I shall expect to see you bright
and early to-morrow morning," resumed Claus,
as he finished his game and hung the cue up
in its proper place. "Here is a dollar. You
may get yourself all the cigars you want."</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing," said Casper to
himself, as he turned to leave the room.
"The last game I played with you you got
an even five dollars out of me. This does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
not make me straight with you by a long
way."</p>

<p>Casper did not rise bright and early the
next morning, because he did not think there
was any need of it. He spent a quarter of
Claus's dollar for breakfast, smoked a cigar,
and strolled leisurely down to the telegraph
office. He was just in time to see Julian and
Jack coming out. The face of the former
wore a very sad expression, and there was a
suspicious redness about his eyes, which
looked as though he had been crying.</p>

<p>"By gracious! I don't think I would shed
tears if I were in your place," said Casper, in
disgust. "And you are going away with a
hundred thousand dollars in your pocket! It
beats me, how many people go to make up a
world! Julian has been bidding them good-bye
in there, and so he must be getting ready
to go off very soon. Now I will go and see
Claus."</p>

<p>Casper found his companion in guilt at the
very place he said he would be; and, for a
wonder, he was sitting there alone, in one
corner of the room. He told what he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
seen, adding that Julian could not keep back
his tears when he came out.</p>

<p>"We'll give him something to cry for when
he goes out of that car," said Claus, with a
wink; "he will be just a fortune out of
pocket."</p>

<p>Casper had several times been on the point
of asking Claus how he was going to work in
order to secure to himself the full possession
of all that property. He thought there would
have to be some legal steps taken before the
agent, or whoever had charge of those blocks
of buildings, would be willing for Claus to
call them all his own. Suppose the agent
should write to some of the many friends he
was presumed to have in Chicago, and should
get no answer from them; what would Claus
do then? All the friends he had were in St.
Louis; he did not know anybody in Chicago,
and consequently he would receive a check at
the very start. If the German thought of
this, he did not say anything about it. He
wanted first to get the box, and then he could
settle these things afterward.</p>

<p>"Well, there is only one thing for you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
do now," said Claus, after thinking the matter
over; "you must stay around Julian's
room, and wait for them to go to the depot.
You will find me right here."</p>

<p>"I shall want a cigar to smoke in the meantime,"
said Casper.</p>

<p>It was right on the end of Claus's tongue
to make a flat refusal, but there was something
in Casper's eye, which he turned full
upon him, that made him hesitate. He
growled out something about not being made
of money, but finally put his hand into his
pocket and produced another dollar.</p>

<p>"You need not mutter so lustily every
time I ask you for money," said Casper to
himself as he left the pool-room. "I will
have to give up this business before long, and
I am going to make all I can."</p>

<p>Casper went straight to a restaurant and
got his dinner, and with a cigar for company
took up his usual hiding-place in the doorway
and waited to see what was going to happen.
He stayed there until four o'clock in the afternoon,
and then began to grow interested.
He saw Julian come out and hasten away,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
and something told him that he had gone for
a carriage. But why was it that Casper got
so mad, and threw his cigar spitefully down
upon the pavement? Julian was dressed in a
suit of new clothes, and he looked like a
young gentleman in it. The suit that Casper
wore was the only one he had, and when that
was gone he did not know what he should do
to get another.</p>

<p>"That fellow must have received a good
many tips while he was in the office," muttered
Casper, "or else he saved his money.
I wish to goodness I had saved mine, instead
of giving it all to Claus."</p>

<p>Julian soon came back with a carriage, and
it became evident that they were going to
take the train for Denver. Julian and the
hackman went upstairs, and when the boys
came down again they each wore a traveling-coat
and had a small valise in their hands.
They got into the carriage and were driven
away for the depot.</p>

<p>"Now, then, I am going to see if Claus is
fooled," thought Casper, as he hurried off in
another direction. "The box is not in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
gripsacks; they are not large enough. Now,
you mark what I tell you."</p>

<p>"What's the news?" said Claus, who was
loitering at one of the windows of the pool-room.
"Did you see them go?" he asked, in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"I did," answered Casper. "We have
just time to get down there, and that is all.
You are making a mistake by not taking some
baggage along."</p>

<p>"No, I am not. We shall go as far as the
station at which the passengers take breakfast,
and then we will stop and come back.
That is as far as we want to go."</p>

<p>"And come back as empty-handed as we
went," said Casper to himself. "I'll bet
there won't be anything worth having in
those valises."</p>

<p>It took Claus and Casper a long time to
walk to the depot, although they went with
all the speed they could command; but when,
at last, they got there, they found that the
ticket office was not open. It was no trouble
at all for them to find the boys whom they
were seeking; they occupied a couple of seats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
in the gentlemen's waiting-room, sitting pretty
close together, too, and were engaged in earnest
conversation.</p>

<p>"Those are the ones, are they not?" questioned
Claus. "They are dressed up so fine
that I would not have known them."</p>

<p>"Yes; they have new clothes on," said
Casper. "They are going off as though they
were business men starting out on a vacation."</p>

<p>"That is the way we will travel when we
get our money," said Claus, with a wink.</p>

<p>"And when we do get it you may go your
way and I will go mine," said Casper to himself;
"I am not going to stay around where
you are all the while bothering me to play a
game with you. I am going to save my
money; that's what I will do."</p>

<p>It was shortly after they reached the depot
that the ticket office was opened, and Julian
went to purchase tickets for himself and companion.
Casper watched them until they
were safe in the train, and then Claus bought
two tickets for Casper and himself, and they
took seats in the car behind Julian's. In that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
way they would keep out of sight. They did
not intend to show themselves until the train
stopped for breakfast the next morning, and
then they would show themselves to some
purpose.</p>

<p>The night was a long and wearisome one to
Casper, who did not once close his eyes in
slumber. He was wondering what was going
to be the result of this new scheme of theirs,
and telling himself over and over again that
it would not amount to anything. It did not
look reasonable that the boys should carry
their box in a valise, and leave it behind
when they went to breakfast while there was
so much in it that needed their constant care.</p>

<p>"And then, after he gets the valises and
finds that there is nothing in them, that is the
time for me to look out," thought Casper.
"He won't get away from me if I have to
stay awake for two or three nights to watch
him."</p>

<p>Finally, to Casper's immense relief, day
began to dawn and some of the wakeful passengers
to bestir themselves. He arranged
his hair with the aid of a comb which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
in his pocket, and then sat on the seat and
waited impatiently for Claus to wake up. All
night long the German had slumbered heavily,
as though he felt at peace with himself and
all the world. That was something that Casper
could not understand. Here he was, fully
intending to steal a fortune from a boy who
had come honestly by it, and yet he could
sleep peacefully and quietly over it!</p>

<p>"I wonder if I shall be the way he is?"
soliloquized Casper. "I will try this once, and
if we don't get the box I will go back and go
to work&mdash;that's the best thing I can do."</p>

<p>It was not long before a brakeman came in
and told them that they were approaching the
place where they would be allowed fifteen
minutes for breakfast; whereupon Casper
leaned over and shook Claus by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"It was time you were getting up," said he
in a whisper; "it is time to go to work."</p>

<p>"I heard every word that was said," said
Claus. "This is the place to which I bought
tickets, and it is as far as we shall go. Go
forward, and see if they are in the car ahead
of us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"But suppose they see me?" said Casper.</p>

<p>"You must not let them see you. Keep
out of their sight. If they leave their valises
behind when they go out to breakfast, it is all
I want."</p>

<p>Casper went, but he walked slowly, as if he
did it under protest. When he arrived at the
end of the car he found he could not see anything
from there, so he opened the door and
went out on the platform. He was gone a
good while, but when he came back his face
told Claus all he wished to know.</p>

<p>"They are there," Casper whispered, "and
are getting ready to go out. I saw the valises
in the rack over their seats."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Now, when we go out
you must keep close behind me. I will come
in at the front end of the car as if I had a
perfect right there, and if I say anything to
you, you must just nod your head."</p>

<p>"What must I do that for?" asked Casper.</p>

<p>"Because there may be somebody looking.
I want to convince everybody that I have a
right to the valises. Now, you go on ahead,
and do as I tell you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>Casper did not approve of this plan at all.
The understanding between him and the German
was that he was to have no hand in
stealing the valises, but this looked as though
he was the prime mover in the affair. Before
he could make any further objection the cars
stopped, the gong sounded for breakfast, and
the passengers began to move toward the
door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>HOW CASPER WAS SERVED.</h3>

<p>"Come on, now, and remember what I told
you," said Claus, getting on his feet.
"There they go! All we have to do, now, is
to go in there and get the valises. You know
where they sat, don't you?"</p>

<p>Casper glanced toward the front end of the
car, and saw Julian and Jack step down and
hurry toward the dining-room. Claus waited
until most of the passengers got off, and then,
with a motion to Casper to follow him, he
went boldly forward and climbed the steps.
He opened the door, and, when Casper went
in, he said,</p>

<p>"Now tell me exactly where they sat, so
that I can pick up the valises without exciting
anybody's suspicions."</p>

<p>"Do you see that red-faced man sitting on
the right-hand side?" whispered Casper.
"And do you see those valises in the rack directly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
in front him? Well, they are the ones
you want."</p>

<p>"All right! We will have them out of
there in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"I don't like the way that man looks at
us," Casper ventured to remark; "perhaps he
knows them."</p>

<p>"It don't make any difference to me
whether he does or not. If he says anything
to us, we will tell him the valises belong
to us, and that we have come after
them."</p>

<p>Calling a smile to his face, Claus went
down the passage-way, looking at the various
valises stowed away in the racks. When he
arrived opposite the seat where Julian had
sat before he left the train, a look of surprise
spread over his countenance, and he stepped
in and took them down, one after the other.</p>

<p>"These are ours, ain't they?" he asked,
turning to Casper.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;they are the ones."</p>

<p>"I don't see what those boys put them in
here for. Now we will take charge of them
ourselves."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>He passed one valise to Casper, who took it
and made his way out of the car, while Claus
kept close at his heels.</p>

<p>"Now we want to go somewhere and get
out of sight as soon as we can," said Casper,
looking around guiltily, and almost expecting
a policeman to take him by the collar. "I
shall not feel easy until this train goes."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't want to get out of sight
just yet," said Claus. "That red-faced man
kept his eyes on us, didn't he? Let us see
what he will make of it now."</p>

<p>"Why, Claus, you are not going in there?"
queried Casper, when his companion led the
way toward the waiting-room. "Julian and
Jack went in there, and they will be certain
to discover us."</p>

<p>"No, they won't. You follow me, and do
just as I do."</p>

<p>Casper turned his eyes and looked back at
the train. There was the red-faced man, sitting
by the car window, closely watching all
their movements, and when he saw them enter
the waiting-room into which Julian and Jack
had gone a few moments before, his suspicions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
if he had any, were set at rest, and he settled
back in his seat and picked up a newspaper
which he had just purchased. Claus kept on
to the waiting-room, but he did not stop when
he got there. He kept right on through and
went out at the other door, and after walking
briskly for a few minutes, and turning several
corners until he was sure that the depot had
been left out of sight, he seated himself on the
steps of a deserted house, took off his hat, and
wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>"It was not such an awful thing to get
those valises, after all," said he. "When that
train goes, we will go and get our breakfast."</p>

<p>"But I would like to know what is in those
valises first," said Casper. "I tell you, you
are fooled. I have felt this valise all over on
the outside, and there is nothing in it that
feels like a box."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you could feel anything
of that kind in it, because I don't believe the
box was put in there," said Claus. "My only
hope is that they took the papers out of the
box and put them in here; consequently they
left the box at home."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"Good enough!" exclaimed Casper, catching
up his valise and feeling the outside of it,
to see if he could feel anything that seemed
like papers that were stowed away on the inside
of it; "I never thought of that. Now,
how shall we go to work to get the valises
open? I haven't a key in my pocket that
will fit them."</p>

<p>"I haven't, either; but as soon as we get
our breakfast we will go up the road a little
distance and cut them open. These gripsacks
will never be worth anything to anybody after
we get done with them."</p>

<p>Even while they were talking in this way
they heard the shriek of the whistle twice,
followed by the ringing of the bell, and knew
that their train was getting ready to start on
again; whereupon Claus got up and said he
was as hungry as a wolf, and that he must
procure a breakfast somewhere.</p>

<p>"I shall not eat much till I find out what
those valises are hiding from us," said Casper.
"It would be just dreadful if we should
fail, after all the trouble we have been to."</p>

<p>By the time they got back to the depot the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
train was well under way; but Claus went out
and looked after it, to satisfy himself that the
coast was clear. Then they placed their
valises in charge of the clerk at the desk, enjoyed
a good wash, and went in and took
their seats at the table. Their meal was a
better one than they had had served up to
them at St. Louis, especially when they were
hard up for money; and, after taking their
time in eating it, Claus settled the bill, took
his valise, and started up the railroad track.</p>

<p>"Have you a cigar?" he asked, before they
had gone a great ways. "That is all right.
We will go on until we get into that sagebrush,
and then we will stop and look into
these things. I will take just a hundred
thousand dollars for my find."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you will take less than that," said
Casper; for, somehow, he could not get over
the idea that the box had been sent by express.
"There is nothing in them that you
want."</p>

<p>It did not take them more than a quarter
of an hour to get into the sagebrush; and,
after looking all around to make sure that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
there was no one in sight, they stepped down
from the track and seated themselves on the
bank beside it. Claus did not waste any
time in trying his keys upon the valise, but
stretched out his legs and put his hand into
his pocket, and when he pulled it out again
he held a knife in it.</p>

<p>"The shortest way is the best," said he,
thrusting the blade into the valise he held in
his hand. "Come out here, now, and let us
see what you have."</p>

<p>His knife made short work of the valise,
but nothing in the way of papers could be
found. It was Jack's valise that he had destroyed,
and all he found in it was a brush
and comb, and half a dozen handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"I just knew how it would be," said Casper,
despairingly. "You will find the same
things in here."</p>

<p>He had never seen Claus look so angry and
disappointed as he was at that moment. With
a spiteful kick of one foot he sent the valise
out of sight in the sagebrush, and was about
to send the other things to keep it company,
when he happened to think of something.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I'll keep the handkerchiefs and
brush and comb for the good they may do
me," said he. "Where's your valise?"</p>

<p>Casper handed it over, and in a moment
more that valise was a wreck, also. They
found things in it similar to those found in
Jack's gripsack, with the exception of a book
which Julian had purchased to read on his
journey, the leaves of which were uncut.
Casper took possession of the handkerchiefs
and the brush and comb, while Claus slowly
rolled up the book and sat with his eyes fastened
on the ground. He was mad&mdash;Casper
could easily see that, and he dared not interrupt
his train of thought. Claus sat for some
moments communing with his own thoughts,
then broke into a whistle and got upon his
feet.</p>

<p>"To say that I am disappointed, and angry,
too, would not half express my feelings," said
he, pulling off his hat with one hand and digging
his fingers into his head with the other.
"I did not suppose they would send those
papers by express, for I know it is something
that I would not have done. I would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
kept them by me all the while, so that I could
see that they were safe. Now, the next thing
is to determine upon something else."</p>

<p>"Do you intend to make another effort to
get the money?" asked Casper, very much
surprised. "Your 'three times and out' did
not amount to anything&mdash;did it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose it did," said Claus,
who was evidently thinking about something
else. "I guess you have done about all you
can do, and so you had better go back to St.
Louis."</p>

<p>This was nothing more than Casper expected.
He had his ten dollars stowed away
somewhere about his clothes, together with
small sums which he had saved from the
amount that Claus had paid him, and so he
could pay his way back to St. Louis easily
enough; but what should he do when he got
there? He shuddered when he thought of it.
Here was winter coming on, and unless he
should obtain work very soon he would have
to go out to where his mother lived, which was
all of two hundred and fifty miles from there.
And what should he say when he got home?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
He had gone to St. Louis with big boasts of
what he intended to do when he got there, and
for him to turn up penniless and friendless at
his mother's house was rather more than he
had bargained for.</p>

<p>"And what will <i>you</i> do?" asked Casper.</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to think the matter
over," said Claus, who was rather surprised
that his companion took his discharge, or
whatever you might call it, so easily, "but I
think I shall go on to Denver."</p>

<p>"And I can't be of any use to you there?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you can. I may not be
back to the city before next spring."</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me what you are
going to do when you get there. You can't
get the box; that will be safe in the bank."</p>

<p>"But perhaps I can pass myself off for Mr.
Haberstro. I have some of his cards in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"But you will only get yourself into trouble
if you try that game. There are people out
there who know Haberstro."</p>

<p>"Well, that is so," said Claus, looking reflectively
at the ground. "I shall have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
think up some way to get around that. At
any rate, you cannot be of any further use to
me, and so you had better start by the next
train."</p>

<p>"Well, you had better give me some money
before you turn me off in this way," said Casper.
"How am I going to get back to the city
without money?"</p>

<p>"Where is that ten dollars you got out of
the telegraph office when your time was up?"
asked Claus, who did not like it whenever the
subject of giving some of his hard earnings
was brought up before him. "You have not
spent all of that, I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. I have just a quarter, and
there it is," said Casper, pulling out of his
pocket the coin in question.</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness I had never seen you!"
said Claus, shoving his hand into the pocket
in which he kept his money. Casper heard
the jingling of some silver pieces, and thought
that perhaps his companion might be tempted
to give him a few dollars. That would be
better than nothing, and he would have some
money left when he reached St. Louis. "If I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
had never seen you, I would have more
dollars left in my pocket than I have now,"
said Claus, bringing out a handful of small
change.</p>

<p>Casper said nothing in reply. He wanted
to see how much Claus was going to give him;
and, once he had the money in his hand, he
could talk to him as he pleased.</p>

<p>"There are five dollars that I will give you,
and you need not ask me for any more," said
Claus, counting out the money; "for, if you
do, you won't get it."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether five dollars will pay
my fare to St. Louis or not," said Casper.
"Give me six."</p>

<p>"No, sir; that's all I have to spare. It
will take you so close to the city that you can
easily walk in," said Claus, turning on his
heel and starting toward the town they had
just left. "You can walk twenty-five miles
very easily."</p>

<p>It was right on the point of Casper's
tongue to "open out" on Claus, and give him
as good as he sent. Wouldn't he have had
more dollars in <i>his</i> pocket if he had never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
met the man who was anxious at all times to
play a game of billiards or pool with him, especially
on pay-day, when Casper was known
to have money in his pocket? But, on thinking
the matter over, he decided that he would
say nothing about it. Claus was a pretty big
man, and there was no knowing what he
would do if the boy made him angrier than
he was now.</p>

<p>"He is going to be fooled again," said Casper,
as he fell in behind Claus, who walked
toward the town as if he were in an awful
hurry to get there. "What good will it do
him to go on to Denver? He can't get the
box there, neither can he cheat Julian out of
his money. Julian will find any amount of
friends there&mdash;I never heard of a boy with a
hundred thousand dollars in his pocket who
could not find somebody to stand by him&mdash;and
they will tell him what to do. Oh! why
did I make so great a mistake! I ought to
have started for Denver the moment I got my
hands on that box. Well, I got five dollars
out of Claus, anyhow."</p>

<p>Casper sauntered along behind Claus, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
was walking rapidly, and when he reached the
depot he looked all around for his companion,
but failed to see him. Claus had gone off
somewhere, and Casper was there alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>HOW A MINE WAS HAUNTED.</h3>

<p>"Well, boys," said Mr. Fay, when they
had reached the street and were
walking toward their hotel, "I have somehow
taken a great interest in you, and I am anxious
to see you come out all right. It is the
most remarkable thing I ever heard of. You
did not know what was in that box when you
bought it, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Julian; "it was all
sealed up. The auctioneer said something
about a miner having hidden the secret of a
gold-mine in it, and I bought it for thirty
cents."</p>

<p>"The auctioneer happened to hit the matter
right on the head. I will go with you in
search of a cheaper boarding-house than the
one at which you are now stopping, and you
had better remain there until Mr. Gibson
hears from those people in St. Louis. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
will be two weeks, probably. If, at any time,
you grow weary of walking about our city,
looking at what little there is worth seeing,
come down to the office, and we'll sit there
and swap a few lies."</p>

<p>Mr. Fay continued to talk in this way
while they were walking along the streets,
meanwhile turning several corners, and the
longer he talked the more the boys saw the
traits of his Western character sticking out
all over him. He talked like a gentleman,
and then spoiled it all by remarking that they
would "swap a few lies" when they came
around to his office. He had probably been
out West so long that he had become accustomed
to Western ways of conversation.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Fay turned off from the
sidewalk, ascended the steps that led to the
door of a house, saying, as he did so, "Now
we will go in here and see what we can do,"
and rang the door-bell. It was a very different-looking
house from the one they had been
in the habit of living in when in St. Louis.
There were no broken-down doors to be opened
before they went in, nor any rickety steps to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
be climbed, but everything was neat and trim,
and kept in perfect order. A motherly-looking
old lady answered Mr. Fay's pull at the
bell.</p>

<p>"Ah! good-morning, Mrs. Rutherford,"
was the way in which Mr. Fay greeted her.
"Let me introduce Julian Gray and John
Sheldon. They are looking around for a
cheap boarding-house,&mdash;not too cheap, mind
you,&mdash;and I have called to see if you have
any place in which to hang them up for the
night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutherford was glad to meet Julian
and Jack, invited them into the parlor, and
asked them if they wanted a room together.
The boys replied that they did, and she conducted
them upstairs, to show them a room
that was vacant. They were gone not more
than five minutes, and when they came downstairs
again Mrs. Rutherford was putting
some bills away in her pocket-book, and the
boys acted as though they were well satisfied.</p>

<p>"Well, you have found a place, have you?"
said Mr. Fay. "Have you jotted down the
street and number?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>No, the boys had not thought of that, and
Julian quickly pulled his note-book from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Your city is somewhat larger than we
expected to find it," began Julian.</p>

<p>"You don't find many wigwams around
here now," answered Mr. Fay. "We keep
spreading out all the time. Can you boys
find the way back to your hotel?"</p>

<p>Julian and Jack thought they could find it
if they were given time enough, but Mr. Fay
thought he had better go with them. It was
right on the road to his office, and he walked
off so rapidly that his young companions were
obliged to increase their speed in order to
keep up with him. Before they had gone a
great way, Julian, who was anxious to learn
all he could about their surroundings, asked
how far it was to the mountains behind them.
Mr. Fay had evidently answered such questions
before, for all he said in reply was,</p>

<p>"How far do you think it is?"</p>

<p>"I think two miles would cover the distance,"
he answered, for he was determined
he would guess enough while he was about it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"How far do <i>you</i> say it is, John?" said
Mr. Fay, turning to Jack.</p>

<p>"I would rather be excused from expressing
an opinion, but I think we could walk
out there in two hours."</p>

<p>"And come back the same day?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; certainly."</p>

<p>"Now, let me tell you," said Mr. Fay:
"If you have made up your minds to go out
to the mountains, hire a good, fast walking-horse,
and go out one day and come back the
next."</p>

<p>"Is it as far as that?" exclaimed the boys,
looking at each other with amazement.</p>

<p>"It is all of twelve miles. You must take
into consideration that the air is very rare up
here, and that things appear nearer than
they are. You are 5135 feet above the level
of the sea."</p>

<p>"My goodness! I didn't think we were so
far out of the world!"</p>

<p>"We have awfully uncertain weather here,"
continued Mr. Fay, "but still we regard our
climate as healthy. Our thermometer sometimes
changes as much as forty degrees in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
twenty-four hours. Since Professor Loomis
took charge of the matter, the mercury has
changed forty-five times in one day. What
sort of a place did you expect to find Denver,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did not know what sort of a place
it was," said Julian. "We thought we should
find more wigwams here than houses, and you
can't imagine how surprised we were when we
found ourselves in a depot full of people."</p>

<p>"Denver used to be full of wigwams, but it
is not so now. Until the year 1858 the Indians
lived in peace; but in that year gold
was discovered by W. G. Russell, a Georgian,
on the banks of the river Platte, which is but
a little way from here, and that settled the
business of the Indians in a hurry. Denver,
Black Hawk, Golden City, and many other
cities that I can't think of now, were founded
in 1859, and a host of immigrants appeared.
Since that time we have been spreading out,
as I told you, until we have a pretty good-sized
city."</p>

<p>"It shows what Western men can do when
they once set about it," said Jack. "Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
answer another question while you are about
it, if you please. If the mercury changes
forty degrees in twenty-four hours, working
in the mines must be dangerous business."</p>

<p>"That depends upon where you are working,"
said Mr. Fay. "If you are at work in
a placer-mine, you stand a good chance of
leaving your bones up there for somebody to
bring home; but if you are working under
the ground, it does not make any difference.
Are you thinking of going out to Dutch Flat
to try your hand at it? I don't know where
that is, but you can find plenty of men here
who can tell you."</p>

<p>"I have not said anything to Julian about
it, but I think that would be one of the best
things we could do. You see, we are not settled
in that property yet."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Fay. "Gibson may get
word from those fellows in St. Louis that you
are impostors, and that you stole that box instead
of buying it at a sale of 'old horse.'
That would be rough on you."</p>

<p>The boys did not know how to take this remark.
They looked at Mr. Fay, but he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
walking along as usual, with his hands in his
pockets, bowing right and left to the many
persons he met on the streets, and did not
seem to think anything of it. Perhaps it was
his ordinary style of talking.</p>

<p>"I am not at all afraid of that," remarked
Jack. "If he finds us impostors, we are willing
to go to jail."</p>

<p>Mr. Fay threw back his head and laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"I have no idea of anything of the kind,"
said he, as soon as he could speak. "I was
just wondering what you would think of it.
But what were you going to say?"</p>

<p>"This property is not settled on us yet,"
replied Jack, "and we may want something
to keep us in grub while we are here. We
have a perfect right to work that mine, have
we not?"</p>

<p>"If you can find it&mdash;yes. Go up there,
and if nobody else is working it, pitch in and
take fifty thousand dollars more out of it."</p>

<p>"And what will we do if somebody else is
working it?"</p>

<p>"You had better give up to them, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
you think you are strong enough to get the
better of them. But you need not worry
about that. The mine is haunted, and you
won't catch any of the miners going around
where ghosts are."</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose are haunting it?"
asked Julian. "That letter says the writer
worked the mine alone, and took lots of
money out of it, and never saw a thing to
frighten him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps somebody has been murdered up
there; I don't know. You won't see anything
until you get down in the mine, and
then you want to look out. I heard of a mine
up at Gold Cove that was haunted in that way.
There were a dozen miners tried it, and each
one came away without getting anything,
although the gold was lying on top of the
ground. As often as a miner went below (it
was about thirty feet down to the bottom), he
was sure to see somebody at work there before
him. He was picking with a tool at the bottom
of the shaft in order to loosen it up, accompanying
every blow he made with a sonorous
'whiz!' which showed that he was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Irishman. Some of the miners retreated to
their bucket and signaled to their helper to
pull them up, and you couldn't hire them to
go into the mine again. Others, with a little
more bravery than they had, went up to put
their hands on the man, but as fast as they advanced
he retreated; and when they got to the
end of the shaft, the phantom miner was still
ahead, and picking away as fast as ever."</p>

<p>"Then the mine is deserted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and has been for years. It is one of
the richest mines around here, too."</p>

<p>"Why, I should think somebody would
shoot him," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Shoot him! He has been shot at more
times than anybody could count; but he pays
no attention to it. He is a ghost, and he
knows you can't hurt him. I never saw it,
and, what is more, I don't want to; but I
would not go down into that mine for all the
gold there is in the hills."</p>

<p>"Did anybody think a murder had been
committed somewhere around there?" said
Julian.</p>

<p>"I never heard that there was."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I just wish our mine would be
haunted with something like that," said Jack.
"I would find out what he was, and what
business he had there, or I would know the
reason why."</p>

<p>"Well, you may have a chance to try it.
Does this look like your hotel? Now I will
bid you good-bye, and I will see you again to-morrow,
if you come around."</p>

<p>Mr. Fay departed, taking with him the
hearty thanks of the boys for all his kindness
and courtesy, and then they slowly ascended
the steps to the office. They had secured one
thing by his attentions to them&mdash;a boarding-house
at which the money they had in their
pockets would keep them safely for a month,
if it took Mr. Gibson that long to hear from
St. Louis; but, on the whole, Jack wished Mr.
Fay had not used his Western phraseology so
freely.</p>

<p>"Does he want us to work that mine or
not?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I don't know. He talked pretty readily,
did he not?"</p>

<p>"I wonder if that is the way all Westerners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
talk? Did he scare you out of going up there
to that mine?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Julian, emphatically.
"Do you know that I rather like that man?
He reminds me of Mr. Wiggins, and talks exactly
like him."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose it was that those fellows
saw in that mine?"</p>

<p>"I give it up. Some of these Western men
are good shots with a revolver, and it seems to
me they might have struck the fellow if they
had had a fair chance at him."</p>

<p>"But he was a ghost, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, get out! If they saw him there, you
can bet that there <i>was</i> somebody there. Some
of the miners had their minds all made up
to see something, and of course they saw it."</p>

<p>"But how do you account for that 'whiz!'
that he uttered every time he struck with his
pick?"</p>

<p>"They never heard any 'whiz!' coming
from that man; they only imagined it."</p>

<p>"Do you think their ears could be deceived,
as well as their eyes?"</p>

<p>"Jack, I am surprised at you. You are big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
enough and strong enough to whip any ghost
that I ever saw, and yet you are afraid to go
down in that mine!"</p>

<p>"Wait until we find it, and then I'll show
you whether I am afraid or not. Now, if you
will go on and pay our bill and have our trunk
brought down, I'll go and get a carriage."</p>

<p>In five minutes this was done, and the boys
were soon on their way to their boarding-house.

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>GOOD NEWS.</h3>

<p>For a week after Julian and Jack went to
their new boarding-house they had
much to occupy their attention&mdash;so much, indeed,
they did not think of going down to
the telegraph office and "swapping a few
lies" with the chief operator. Their new
home charmed them in every particular.
Mr. Fay had not forgotten that <i>he</i> had been
a boy in the not so very long ago, and the
boarding-house he had chosen for them was
such as he would have chosen for himself.
The boarders were young men who, like themselves,
had come out West to seek their fortunes,
and they were all employed in various
avocations in the city. Jack noticed one
thing, and that was they did not run around
of evenings to any extent; or, if they did,
they went down to the library, where they
spent their time in reading.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know that that is something that
strikes me," said Jack one night when they
went upstairs to their room. "We ought to
join the Young Men's Christian Association."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten our mine?" asked
Julian.</p>

<p>"No, I have not; but I don't believe in
going up there in winter. A thermometer
that can change so many times within twenty-four
hours is something that I want to keep
clear of."</p>

<p>"Well, where is the money to come from?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Jack, who had not thought
of that before; "that's so. Where is it?"</p>

<p>The first thing the boys thought of, when
they got up the next morning, was to take a
trip to the mountains. Jack was in favor of
walking. It was only twelve miles, and the
amount they would have to pay out for a
horse would keep one of them a week at their
boarding-house. But Julian could not see it
in that light.</p>

<p>"I tell you, you have never walked twenty-four
miles in a day," remarked the latter.
"I have done it many a time, but I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
going to do it now, when there is no need
of it."</p>

<p>"You act as though you had that money in
your hands already," retorted Jack. "Now,
I'll tell you what's a fact: I am going to have
the same trouble with you that I had in St.
Louis. There won't be any 'old horse' for
you to spend your money on, but you will
squander it in some other way."</p>

<p>"You will see," said Julian, with a laugh.
"Come on, now; I am going to get a saddle-horse&mdash;one
that can take me out there in an
hour."</p>

<p>Jack reluctantly yielded to his companion,
who made his way toward a livery-stable
which he had seen when they came to their
boarding-house. There they engaged a couple
of saddle-horses which seemed to know what
they were expected to do, for when allowed
the rein they put off toward the mountains,
and went along at a brisk pace. Jack could
not get over grumbling about hiring horses to
do what they could do themselves, but Julian
did not pay the least attention to it. When
they had gone a long distance on the road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
they met a teamster, and of him Jack inquired
how many miles they had yet to travel
to reach their destination.</p>

<p>"Them mountains?" asked the man, facing
about in his seat. "They are a matter of six
miles from here."</p>

<p>"If I had a good start for a run I believe I
could jump that far," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does look that way," said the man;
"but it would be a mighty lengthy jump for
you. I guess you are a tenderfoot&mdash;ain't
you?"</p>

<p>"I never was so far West as this in my
life."</p>

<p>The man had evidently heard all that he
wanted to hear, for he started his team, smiling
and nodding his head as if to say that
Jack would learn more about distances on the
prairie before he had been there long.</p>

<p>The distance was fully as great as the boys
expected to find it; and, when they drew up
in front of a little hotel in the foothills, the
mountains seemed to be as far off as ever.
The proprietor came to the door, bid them
good-morning in his cheery way, and asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
if there was anything that he could do for
them.</p>

<p>"How far off are those peaks from here?"
questioned Jack.</p>

<p>"Twenty miles," said the man. "You are
not going out there to-day, are you?"</p>

<p>"Why, the folks in Denver told us that
the mountains were twelve miles away," said
Jack, greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, you are twelve miles from Denver
now. These little hills here are the beginning
of the mountains."</p>

<p>"I guess you may feed our horses and give
us some dinner, and then we will go back,"
said Julian. "Well, Jack, we've seen the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Yes, and laid out six dollars for the horses
besides," replied Jack, in disgust. "The
next time you want anything to carry you, we
will go on foot."</p>

<p>The man laughed heartily as he took charge
of their horses, and the boys went into the
hotel, where they found a fire on the hearth,
and were glad to draw up close to it.</p>

<p>"I declare, I did not know it was so cold,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
said Julian. "I suppose it is warm enough
in St. Louis. How high is that city above
the sea-level?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Jack, who could
not get over the feeling that those people in
Denver had played too much on his credulity.
"Twenty miles! I guess we won't go up to
the top of those mountains, yet a while, and
look for California. I wish those horses were
back in the stable where they belong."</p>

<p>"We will have them back there in three
hours," answered Julian, "and if you don't
want me to hire any more horses, I won't do
it."</p>

<p>The boys got back to Denver without any
mishap, and after that they were eager to see
the city. Jack did not have anything to
grumble about during the week that followed,
for they went on foot, and there were no
horses hired. Finally, after viewing all the
fine buildings that were to be seen, they
thought of the telegraph operator, and decided
to take him in the next day; so on
Monday they presented themselves at his
office. Mr. Fay was there; and, unlike Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Wiggins, he did not seem to have much to
do, for he was sitting in an easy-chair, with
his feet perched upon the desk in front of
him, playing with a paper-cutter. The boy
who came forward to attend to their wants
seemed to have made up his mind that Mr.
Fay was the man they wanted to see, and so
he conducted them into his private office.</p>

<p>"Halloo! boys," he cried, taking down his
feet and pushing chairs toward them; "you
are here yet, are you? Have you been out to
look at your gold-mine?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Julian; "we could hardly
go out there and come back in a week&mdash;could
we?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe you could. I have
been thinking about you," continued Mr. Fay,
depositing his feet on the desk once more,
"and if you know when you are well off you
won't go out there this fall. I was talking
with a man who has come in from Dutch
Flat, and he says it is getting most too cold
up there to suit him. He has made a heap
of money, and has come here to spend it. I
suppose that is what you will be doing when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
you get to work out there&mdash;make all you want
in summer, and come here in winter and
spend it."</p>

<p>"No, sir," asserted Julian, emphatically;
"we have worked hard for what little money
we have, and we know how to take care of it.
I thought it would not make any difference to
us how cold it was if we were working under
the ground; I thought you said something
like that."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I said so," affirmed Mr. Fay;
"but you will have to take provisions with
you to last you six months. If you don't,
you will get snowed up in the mountains; the
drifts will get so deep that you can't get
through them."</p>

<p>"I did not think of that," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Well, you had better think of it, for if
you get up there, and get blocked by drifts,
my goodness!&mdash;you will starve to death!"</p>

<p>"Did you say anything to the man about
our claim up there?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not, for I did not know where
it was located. I will tell you what you can
do, though. He is going back in the spring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and he can assist you in getting everything
you need."</p>

<p>"We are very much obliged to you for saying
that," responded Jack, who felt that a big
load had been removed from his and Julian's
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am only speaking of what I know of
the man," remarked Mr. Fay. "Miners are
always ready to help one another, and I know
he will do that much for you. I will tell you
where you can see him. Do you know where
Salisbury's hotel is?"</p>

<p>The boys replied that they did not. They
had been all over the city, but did not remember
having seen any sign of that hostelry.</p>

<p>"Well, I will go with you," said Mr. Fay
"Come around about two o'clock and we'll
start. By the way, that lawyer has got back."</p>

<p>"What lawyer, and where has he been?"</p>

<p>"I mean Gibson&mdash;the lawyer that you employed
to do your business for you. He has
been to St. Louis."</p>

<p>"Good enough!" exclaimed Jack. "He
has found out by this time more than we could
tell him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw him last night just as he got off the
train, and he desired me to tell you, if I happened
to see you before he did, that he would
be glad to see you around at his office as soon
as you could get there," said Mr. Fay. "So
you can run down there as soon as you please.
You know where he hangs out&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>Yes, the boys were certain they could find
his office without any help, and arose and put
on their caps. They told Mr. Fay they would
be sure to come around at two o'clock, to go
with him to call upon the miner who had recently
come from Dutch Flat, bade him good-bye,
and left the office.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the situation
now?" asked Julian, as they hurried along
toward the place where the lawyer "hung
out." "Are you still sorry that I bid on that
'old horse?'"</p>

<p>"I only hope there will be no hitch in the
business," said Jack. "If he should ask us
some questions that we could not answer&mdash;then
what?"</p>

<p>"We will tell him the truth," said Julian.
"He can't ask us any questions that we can't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
answer. Claus and Casper could go in on
telling lies, but that way would not suit us."</p>

<p>As the boys had taken particular note of the
location of Mr. Gibson's office, they went
there as straight as though they had been in
Denver all their lives, ran up the stairs to the
first floor, and opened the lawyer's door. Mr.
Gibson was there, as well as two men whom
he was advising on some law-point they had
brought to him to clear up. When the boys
came in he stopped what he was saying,
jumped up, and extended a hand to each of
them.</p>

<p>"I was coming around in search of you fellows
as soon as I got through with these men,"
said he. "How have you boys been, out here,
so far away from home? Please excuse me
for fifteen minutes or so."</p>

<p>The boys took the chairs he offered them,
and for a few minutes kept track of what he
was saying; but that did not last long. It was
about a fence that a neighbor of the two men
had built, but which their cattle had broken
down, and they were anxious to get out of a
lawsuit for the field of wheat their cattle had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
ruined. They heard the lawyer advise them,
honestly, that they must either compromise
the matter or get into a lawsuit, in which case
they would have to pay full damages; and
while he was talking to them he proved that
he was a man who could do two things at once.
He opened a drawer and took out two photographs,
which he compared with the boys, one
after the other. It did not take him long to
decide upon this business, and then he devoted
himself to the question of fences again.</p>

<p>"It is as plain as daylight to me," said he,
as he arose to his feet. "Your cattle broke
the fence down, went in, and ate up the man's
wheat. It was a good, strong, staked-and-ridered
fence, too. There are only two ways
out of it: Yon can either settle the matter
with him, or you can go to law; and if you do
that, you will get beaten."</p>

<p>One of the men then asked him how much
he charged for his advice, and when he said
"Five dollars," the boys cast anxious glances
at each other. If he charged that way for advising
a man to keep out of law, what price
would he demand for taking care of one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
thousand dollars? Mr. Gibson showed
them to the door, bowed them out, and then
turned to the boys.</p>

<p>"I ought to have charged that man ten dollars,"
he declared, with an air of disgust.
"He is always in a row; he never comes here
to seek advice but that he wants to beat somebody.
Do you recognize these pictures?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," replied Julian. "This
is a photograph of me, and that is my signature
on the back; the other one is Jack's."</p>

<p>"I have been to St. Louis since you were
here," Mr. Gibson went on. "I called upon
the men whose addresses you gave me, and
found out all about you. I tried my best to
find Mr. Haberstro, but could not do it, and
so I have concluded that the money is yours."</p>

<p>"Everything?" exclaimed Julian. "The
gold-mine and all?"</p>

<p>"Everything belongs to you," answered
Mr. Gibson; and one would have thought,
from the way in which he announced the fact,
that somebody had left the fortune all to Julian.
"Of course, if Mr. Haberstro ever
turns up you will have to surrender the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
money; but I don't take any stock in his
turning up. Julian, you now have very
nearly twenty thousand dollars coming to
you."</p>

<p>"But Jack must have half," said Julian,
earnestly. "He has stuck to me like a good
fellow, and I don't know what I should have
done without him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that makes you worth ten
thousand dollars apiece."</p>

<p>Julian drew a long breath and looked at
Jack. The latter leaned his elbows on his
knees, whirled his cap in his hand, and looked
at the floor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>MR. BANTA IS SURPRISED.</h3>

<p>"You fellows look surprised," said Mr.
Gibson, running his eyes from one to
the other of the boys. "It seems to me, if a
man told me I had that amount of money
coming to me, and that I had ten thousand
dollars where I could draw on it at my leisure,
this room would not hold me; I should
want the whole city to splurge in."</p>

<p>The boys made no reply. Jack drew his
hand once or twice across his forehead, as if
to brush away some wrinkles, while Julian
got up and walked to the window.</p>

<p>"You did not expect to get it&mdash;did you?"
continued Mr. Gibson.</p>

<p>"No, sir, we did not," replied Julian;
"but we hoped to get it. We tried our level
best to find Mr. Haberstro, following the advice
of Mr. Wiggins in everything he told us
to do; but he was out of our reach."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"He is dead, probably," said Mr. Gibson.
"I know just what you tried to do, and all
about it. Of course there will be some law to
go through with before you can step into the
property. Do you wish me to take charge of
it for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Gibson, we really wish you
would. We know nothing about law, and
consequently we should not know how to act."</p>

<p>"And do you wish me to take charge of
the rental of your blocks of buildings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; go on just as you did before, and
when we want money we will come to you."</p>

<p>"Well, that is a different thing altogether,"
said Mr. Gibson, looking down at the floor.
"The twenty thousand dollars that I told you
of is now in the bank, subject to my order.
I guess I had better go up there with you and
have it changed. You can then get money
whenever you want it. By the way, Julian,
Mr. Wiggins sent his kindest regards to you;
and, furthermore, he gave me a letter which
he wished me to hand to you. I've got one
for you, Jack, from your boss; what do you
call him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"Master mechanic," replied Jack.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson opened his desk and took out
two letters, which he gave to the boys. The
sight of Mr. Wiggins's handwriting on the
envelope was almost too much for Julian, for
he put the letter into his pocket and walked
to the window again.</p>

<p>"There is some good advice in those letters,
and I want you boys to follow it out implicitly,"
said the lawyer. "You will always
find me here, ready to tell you what to do in
case you get into trouble. You must come
to me or to Mr. Fay every time you get into
a box. But, first and foremost, don't have
anything to do with strangers. There are
some of them who are bound to hear of your
good fortune, and will take every means in
their power to get hold of it. Don't sign
any papers unless you bring them to me."</p>

<p>"We have already had a little experience
in that line," said Julian, with a smile.
"Claus came up to us and tried to pass himself
off for Mr. Haberstro, and he is the one
who stole our valises on our way here; but he
didn't make anything by it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I heard all about this man Claus,
and about that friend of yours, Casper Nevins.
You know enough to steer clear of such fellows
in future. Now, if you are all through,
we'll go up to the bank."</p>

<p>The boys followed Mr. Gibson out of the
office, along the street, turning three or four
corners, until they reached the bank. He
did not have any business to do with the man
who stood behind the desk counting out the
money, but he simply asked him,</p>

<p>"Is E. A. in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he is in his private office," replied
the cashier.</p>

<p>The boys did not know who E. A. was, but
they found out a moment later, for the lawyer
led them into the presence of the president of
the bank. He was gray-headed and wore a
pair of gold spectacles, but he stopped his
work and shook Mr. Gibson warmly by
the hand. He looked curiously at the boys,
but when the lawyer began his story, talking
very rapidly, for there was a card hung
up over his desk which said on it, "This
is my busy day," he laid down his pen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
and glanced at Julian and Jack with some
interest.</p>

<p>"And you want the twenty thousand dollars
changed, so that it will be subject to their
order?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that is my errand up here."</p>

<p>The president got upon his feet and walked
into the room where the cashier was. When
he went, the boys had not more than ten dollars
in their pockets that they could call their
own; when he came back, they had a small
fortune coming to them.</p>

<p>"It is all right," said he. "And which of
you boys was it who bid on the 'old horse?'"
he continued, extending a hand to each of
them. "You are the one? Well, my son,
remember that there is an end to your money
somewhere, and if you go to work and spend
it all without waiting for some more to come
in, the end of it is not far off. I wish you
good luck."</p>

<p>The boys retraced their steps to the cashier's
desk, and the transfer of the property from
Mr. Gibson's order to their own was easily
completed. Mr. Gibson signed a check, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
boys attached their names to a big book
which was thrust out at them, and then the
cashier wanted to know if they needed any
money.</p>

<p>"We would like about one hundred dollars
apiece," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Very well; make out a check for it and
sign your names to it, and you can get it all
right. You will find the checks there on that
desk."</p>

<p>The boys accordingly made out their checks
for the money, and Mr. Gibson stood watching
them, smiling to himself when he saw how
the boys' hands trembled, and how anxious
they were to have everything correct. The
money was paid on the checks, and Julian
and Jack put it into their pockets.</p>

<p>"You got it, didn't you?" said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; thanks to you, we have got it,"
said Julian. "Mr. Gibson, I can't begin to
tell you how much we thank you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is all right," said the lawyer,
opening the door of the bank; "only, don't get
into a fuss and lose it all."</p>

<p>"When we came here," continued Julian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
"we had no money at all; now see how different
it is! I assure you that we are not
going to get into any fuss. The money is
safe where it is."</p>

<p>"Well, let it stay there. I am pretty busy
this morning, so I beg that you will excuse
me. Good-bye."</p>

<p>The lawyer hurried away, and Julian stood
a little on one side of the door of the bank,
one hand thrust into his pocket where he had
placed the bills, and his eyes fastened upon
Mr. Gibson as long as he remained in sight.</p>

<p>"Say, Jack," said he, suddenly; "I don't
believe Mr. Gibson had any right to give us
this money."</p>

<p>"He hadn't?" exclaimed Jack. "Why, it
was his."</p>

<p>"No, it was not; it belongs to that Haberstro
estate. It seems to me he ought to have
got an order from the court before giving any
of the money up to us."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has an order," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Then why did he not say something about
it? I would like to know when the court
sits. If the Judge finds any blundering in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
the business, why, then we are up a stump.
What will we do if this man Haberstro comes
up, all on a sudden, and tells us he wants this
hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Jack; "I did not think of
that."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Gibson probably knew what the
decision of the court was going to be or he
would not have done this," added Julian, after
a moment's pause. "I guess we are all right,
but I shall feel better when we have all that
property in our hands."</p>

<p>Julian wished now, when it was too late,
that he had not spoken to Jack about this.
During the dinner hour he was unusually
silent and thoughtful, and the landlady's
questioning could not get a word out of him.
He would arouse up long enough to reply,
and then he would fall to thinking again.</p>

<p>"I will never tell you another piece of news
as long as I live," said Julian, as they went
up to their room to get ready to accompany
Mr. Fay to call on the miner. "You always
have enough to say at dinner, but to-day you
were as solemn as an owl."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>"I could not help it," said Jack. "If that
man who owns this property turns up here, I
tell you we shall be in a fix. We shall spend
this before the winter is over, and how are we
to get a hundred dollars to pay him? I'll
speak to Mr. Gibson about that the next time
I see him."</p>

<p>"I believe that would be a good plan," said
Julian, after thinking the matter over. "I'll
bet you that he has some good reason for it."</p>

<p>In due time the boys arrived at Mr. Fay's
office, and found him ready to accompany
them. All he said was that he was going out
for half an hour, and if anybody came to see
him he was to be told that he would soon be
back; and then he set off, with his long
strides, to lead the way to Salisbury's hotel.
The boys found it as much as they could do to
keep up with him.</p>

<p>"I guess you have been a messenger-boy in
your day," said Julian.</p>

<p>"I was a messenger-boy for six years," replied
Mr. Fay. "Of course I did not want to
hold that position all my life, so I learned
telegraphy at odd times, and got my promotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
as fast as I was qualified for it, until at
last I got where you see me now. That's the
way that young men ought to do&mdash;look out for
promotion."</p>

<p>"We received good news down there at Mr.
Gibson's office," continued Julian.</p>

<p>"I knew you would. Have you the property
all in your hands?"</p>

<p>"No; there is some law-business to go
through with, first. We told Mr. Gibson to
go ahead with it, as he did before."</p>

<p>"That was the best thing that you ever
did," said Mr. Fay, earnestly. "Gibson is an
honest man, even if he is a lawyer, and you
will get every cent that is coming to you.
Now, then, here we are. You will find this
rather a different hotel from the one you first
stopped at when you came here, but the old
fellow makes lots of money out of the miners.
There is nobody stays here except those who
have shovelled dirt."</p>

<p>Mr. Fay opened the door as he spoke, and
the boys speedily found themselves in the
living-room of the hotel. Before they had
time to look around them the chief telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
operator walked up and laid his hand upon
the shoulder of a man who sat with his back
to him.</p>

<p>"You are here yet, are you, Banta?"
said he.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the miner, looking up to see
who it was that accosted him. "I am on hand,
like a bogus coin made out of iron pyrites;
you can't get rid of me."</p>

<p>"I have brought some boys with me who
would like to know something about the mines
at which you are working," said Mr. Fay;
and he proceeded to introduce Julian and
Jack.</p>

<p>Banta speedily proved that he was a gentleman,
for he straightway got upon his feet to
shake hands with the boys.</p>

<p>"All right," said the miner; "if anybody
can tell them about Dutch Flat, I am the
man."</p>

<p>"They are going to stay here this winter,
and go out with you next spring," Mr. Fay
went on.</p>

<p>"All right," said the miner, again; "I will
put them where they can dig gold so fast that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
you won't see anything but gold coming out
of the pit."</p>

<p>"But they have a gold-mine up there
already."</p>

<p>"They have? Where is it located?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fay could not answer this question, so
he stood aside and waited for Julian to tell
him the whereabouts of the mine. The boy
began by asking him,</p>

<p>"Do you know the mine that Winkleman
used to work when he was here?"</p>

<p>Mr. Banta started, and looked at Julian to
see if he was in dead earnest. The boy gazed
fixedly at him, and the miner finally settled
back in his chair and pulled himself down until
his neck rested on the back of it.</p>

<p>"Of course I know that mine," said he.
"You don't think of working there, do
you?"</p>

<p>"We thought some of trying it," replied
Julian.</p>

<p>"Pete, what do you think of that?" asked
Mr. Banta, pushing his hand against the
shoulder of the man who sat nearest him, with
his eyes closed, as if he were fast asleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
"Here are two boys going up to Dutch Flat
next spring to work the Winkleman mine."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Pete, without lifting his
head, "I am glad I am not going up there."</p>

<p>"Are the ghosts so awful thick up there?"
asked Julian, who felt his courage oozing out
at the ends of his fingers.</p>

<p>"You know something about it&mdash;don't
you? The ghosts are so thick up there that
you can't go down in the mine to shovel a
bucketful of dirt without scaring some of
them up."</p>

<p>"Well, you will have to excuse me," said
Mr. Fay. "I should like to see what those
ghosts are, but my work calls me. You will
take charge of the boys next spring, will you,
Mr. Banta?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will; but they are plumb dunces
if they try to work that mine. I will go
with them as far as I can, and the balance
of the way they will have to depend on themselves."</p>

<p>Mr. Fay said he believed they could do
that, opened the door and went out, and Julian
and Jack were left alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>GRUB-STAKING.</h3>

<p>"Sit down," said Banta, pushing chairs
toward the two boys with his foot; "I
want to talk to you about that mine. What
loon has been so foolish as to grub-stake
you?"</p>

<p>"Grub-stake us?" repeated Julian, for the
words were quite new to him.</p>

<p>"Yes; he does not expect to get his money
back again very soon. I mean the fellow who
has furnished you with grub and tools, and
such things, to work the mine with."</p>

<p>"We never heard that before; we did not
know there was anybody who <i>could</i> grub-stake
us."</p>

<p>"Say, Pete, what do you think of that?"
said Banta, once more pushing the man who
sat nearest him. "Here are a couple of
tenderfeet, come away out West from&mdash;where
did you come from?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>"From St. Louis; this is as far West as we
have ever been."</p>

<p>"Here are a couple of tenderfeet from St.
Louis who didn't know that they could get
anybody to grub-stake them," continued Banta.
"What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>Pete, who had by this time got his wits
about him, straightened up, pushed his hat on
the back of his head, and regarded the boys
with some curiosity. Julian and Jack looked
at him, too, and concluded that he and Banta
were partners in working a mine. He was
roughly dressed, but there was a good-natured
look about him that made the boys take to
him at once. There were other men, dressed
as miners, in the room, and they all seemed to
be interested in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Then I reckon I shall have to tell you
about this grub-staking business," said Banta,
squaring around in his chair so as to face the
boys. "You are going to lay in a supply of
things yourselves, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are; and we shall have to depend
on you to tell us what to get."</p>

<p>"Well, there is plenty of time between this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
and spring, and we will have time to talk that
over afterward. Now, about this grub-staking
business. There are lots of fellows who
come out here who haven't got the money to
enable them to go prospecting, and what do
they do but hunt up some fellow who is willing
to buck against a hole in the ground, and
get their provisions and tools of him. He
gets half of what they make. The men stay
out there until they have eaten up all their
provisions and then come in; and if they have
had good luck, so much the better. But if
they have wasted their time in looking for
gold where there wasn't any to be found, why,
so much the worse; that man is just so much
out of pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, along in '90 Pete and me struck
this very town, and we flew so light that we
couldn't hardly stay on the ground. We
didn't have enough to buy our next meal
with; but we struck a gang whom we knew,
and headed along with them for the gold
country. Of course we had nothing, but we
managed to strike a grub-stake and went
prospecting up there behind Dutch Flat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
We lit into that rock and dirt, working like
beavers, but the sign didn't come right. It
looked well enough at the start, but it did
not pan out much. We stuck to it for nearly
three months, and then concluded that we
had better go down and get another grub-stake
and strike in somewhere else. So I
stayed up there alone, and Pete went down
and brought up the man that employed us.
He looked at the hole, liked the looks of it,
and wanted us to go farther; but Pete and I
couldn't see it in that light. One word
brought on another, and he offered us three
hundred dollars for the hole."</p>

<p>"For the hole!" exclaimed Julian. "And
there was not a sign of gold about it?"</p>

<p>"Now, hold on till I tell you," returned
Banta. "There was a little sign of gold
about it, but there was not enough to pay
Pete and me for digging. We snapped him
up quicker'n a flash, and what does that man
do? He went down to Dutch Flat, brought
up his tools, and set in to working the hole,
and before he had gone two feet farther he
struck the richest vein you ever clapped your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
eyes on. He took sixty thousand dollars out
of it. Now, some of you fellows talk about
hard luck. If any of you can beat that story,
I'll give you what little I made on Dutch
Flat this summer."</p>

<p>"That <i>was</i> hard luck, I must say," said
Julian. "And you lacked only two feet of
being rich?"</p>

<p>"Only just two feet," returned Banta,
"We might have been running around now
with two niggers to drive the team&mdash;one
dressed as a coachman and the other as a
footman. Pete didn't get over pulling his
hair for a month after that."</p>

<p>"But we are going to stake ourselves next
summer," said Julian. "If we lose, it will
come out of our own pockets. Have you
been anywhere near this mine that we are
going to work?"</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Pete?" exclaimed
Banta. "He wants to know if we
have been near his mine. Not much! I'll
bet there are two hundred miners on Dutch
Flat this minute, and not one of them has
ever seen that mine. They have heard about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
it, they know there is plenty of gold up there,
but nobody has ever been near it. The last
two that went up there came away so badly
frightened that they packed up and left the
country so quick that you could not see them
for the dust they kicked up along the trail.
They saw something down there in the pit,
and it took all the pluck out of them."</p>

<p>"What did they see?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I was a little too fast in
saying that they saw something," said Banta.
"They heard something, and that was as good
as though they had seen it. It first began
with a scurrying on the ground, as if somebody
was hurrying over it. Where it came
from nobody knew; it seemed to fill the air
all around them. Before they had time to
get frightened at this there was a shriek that
made it appear as if the pit was full of unearthly
spirits, and then all was still; but the
fellows had heard enough. The man down
below yelled to his partner to pull him up,
and when he found himself safe on top he
laid down on the ground and swore he would
never go down there again. Oh, you boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
have something to face, if you are going up
there!"</p>

<p>"Could not the sound they heard have
been occasioned by bats that had been disturbed
while trying to take a rest?" asked
Julian. "He had a light, of course."</p>

<p>"Bats!" exclaimed Banta, with deep disgust;
"it was a great deal larger than bats.
And he could have seen them if he had a
light, could he not?"</p>

<p>"And, besides, bats don't shriek that way,"
said a miner who had not spoken before.
"There used to be a miner who was working
that pit along with Winkleman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You hold your yawp," exclaimed Banta,
fiercely; "I am telling the boys nothing but
facts. I want them to know just what they
have to face. I don't go into any of this
cock-and-bull story about a dead miner. If
that man died up there, and was buried, he's
there yet, and he can't come out to work in
the pit any more."</p>

<p>"What about him?" asked Julian. "We
want to know everything connected with the
mine, then we will be prepared for anything."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>"But this thing is not connected with the
mine," said Banta; "it is some sort of a story
the miners have, and there is not a word of
truth in it. They tell about a miner being
seen there by everyone who goes down, and
when you try to get up to him, he is not there.
He goes farther and farther away every time
you approach him."</p>

<p>"We have heard that story before," said
Julian, with a smile; "Mr. Fay knows all
about it."</p>

<p>"Then of course you don't believe it. I
have told you the truth about the mine, and
now you can go up with me next spring or
stay away, just as you have a mind to."</p>

<p>"Oh, we will go with you," said Julian.
"I never was interested in any property yet
that I was afraid to work just on account of
some things you could not see. When we
bid you good-bye at Dutch Flat we shall
know what there is in that mine before we
come back."</p>

<p>"I like your pluck," said Banta; and the
look of admiration he bestowed upon Julian
more than confirmed his words. "If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
live up to that, I hope you will get some
gold."</p>

<p>"They say that gold is plenty up there,"
said another miner. "They say it is lying
around under your feet."</p>

<p>"And you never went there to get it!" exclaimed
Julian with surprise.</p>

<p>"It isn't as thick as that," said Banta.
"Probably every bucketful you send up to be
washed will yield you from ten to fifty dollars.
You will get rich at that rate."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we have troubled you long
enough," said Julian, rising to his feet. "We
are really obliged to you, Mr. Banta, for offering
to take charge of us, although we are
nothing but tenderfeet. There are no Indians
out there, are there?"</p>

<p>"Indians!&mdash;no; and if there were some on
the warpath, we have miners enough up there
to make them hunt their holes."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that; we don't want anything
to do with those savages, after what we
have read about them. We will see you again,
Mr. Banta."</p>

<p>"Do so, and the next time I will tell you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
what things you want to buy, to make your
enterprise successful. Good-morning."</p>

<p>"There's two boys that have gone plumb
crazy," said one of the miners, after the door
had closed upon Julian and Jack. "I wonder
how they got that mine, in the first
place?"</p>

<p>"The boys are bound to get gold there, if
they can stick it out," said another. "One
of the men who came down from there showed
me a piece of metal as big as a marble, which
he had picked up on the bottom of that pit;
but the trouble is, can they stick it out?"</p>

<p>"I believe <i>they</i> will," said Banta, settling
down in his chair once more. "That boy
who did most of the talking is one who has
plenty of 'sand' to see him through. After
they get fairly settled, I believe I'll go up
and see how they are getting along."</p>

<p>"Then you will go without me," said Pete;
"I am as close to that mine as I want to be."</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," said Julian, as he buttoned
his coat, "what do you think of our mine?
Shall we go up and try it? The miners all
think there is gold up there."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>"We will have plenty of time to talk about
that between this time and spring," returned
Jack. "Mr. Haberstro may come up before
we get ready to start, and demand his money."</p>

<p>"I have no fears on that score," replied
Julian. "Did not the lawyer say that he did
not look for that? But, Jack, I really believe
you are afraid of that mine."</p>

<p>"You need not be. When we get up
there, and get things fixed, I will be the first
to go into it."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll stand back and let you.
Now, Jack, what are we going to do this winter?
We can't sit around all the time without
something to occupy our minds."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about that. Let us
call on Mr. Fay, and see what he says."</p>

<p>Julian thought this a piece of advice worth
acting upon, and they bent their steps toward
Mr. Fay's office, where they found him seated,
as before, with his feet on the desk in front
of him. When he saw who his visitors were,
he jumped up hastily and seized each of them
by the arm with a firm grip.</p>

<p>"Oh, boys, you surely haven't made up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
your minds to go up to that mine next spring,
have you?" he asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir," said Julian, somewhat
surprised by the man's actions. "I reckon it
is ours, and we want to see what gold is to be
found in it."</p>

<p>"But think of the ghosts you will have to
contend with," said Mr. Fay. "You will
hear scurrying of feet&mdash;What was that?"
he continued, looking toward a distant part of
his office and pulling the boys around in front
of him. "I am certain there is a ghost there."</p>

<p>Julian and Jack began to see into the matter
now. The man was so full of his fun that
he could not keep it in under any circumstances,
and it had come to the surface when
he saw the boys come into his office. Perhaps
a lingering smile around his mouth had something
to do with it.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you heard any ghost
there," said Julian; "they are so busy up
there at the mine that they have no time to
come down here to trouble you."</p>

<p>"All right, boys; sit down. What did
Banta say the spirits looked like?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>Julian replied that he could not tell, for he
had not seen them; and with this as an introduction
he went on and repeated the miner's
conversation as nearly as he could recall it.
Mr. Fay listened, highly amused, and when
Julian ceased speaking he said,</p>

<p>"If you can see them, what's the use of
your being afraid? And as for that phantom
miner, that happened a long ways from here.
I ought to be kicked for trying to frighten
you."</p>

<p>"It will take something more than that to
scare us out," said Julian. "Now, Mr. Fay,
we want to ask your advice."</p>

<p>"I am ready to give it. Do you want to
invest some property in a gold-mine?"</p>

<p>No; Julian assured him that it had no
reference to their property, which was not
theirs yet until the court had passed upon it,
but it was in regard to their going to school
in order to learn something. Mr. Fay was
all attention now, and when Julian spoke of
joining some mercantile academy, he slapped
his hands down upon his knees as if that was
the best thing the boys could do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no fears that your money will not
prove useful to you," said he; "the idea of
your wanting to go to school is a big feather
in your caps. Some young men, with such
an amount of money as you have coming to
you, would loaf around and do nothing until
their funds were all gone; but you don't act
that way. Believe me, there is an end to that
hundred thousand dollars somewhere."</p>

<p>"That is just what the president of the
bank told us when we called upon him," said
Julian. "We have worked so hard for the
little money we have that we intend to take
care of it. But, Mr. Fay, we don't believe
that Mr. Gibson did right in giving us these
funds."</p>

<p>"What's the reason you don't?"</p>

<p>"Why, he said he would have to get word
from the court before all the property could
be turned over to us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right; Mr. Gibson knew
what he was doing. You will find it all
right when the Judge hears the case. Now,
do you know where the business college is
situated?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>Julian was not so sure about that, but he
received certain instructions from Mr. Fay
that made him think he could find it; so the
boys put on their caps and went out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>GOING TO SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>"Is the boss mechanic anywhere about?"
asked Jack, who chanced to be the first
who entered the college when they found it.</p>

<p>They had opened a door, and found themselves
in one of the study-rooms of the school.
There were fifty men and women there, all interested
with their books, and the best of order
prevailed. A young man, whose seat was near
the door, on seeing that the boys were strangers,
had arisen and asked them what he could
do for them.</p>

<p>"The boss mechanic?" he repeated, in a
surprised tone.</p>

<p>"He means the man who is at the head of
this institution," said Julian. We want to see
him for a few minutes, if you please."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the young man, as he
gave Jack a looking over. "I guess you have
worked at manual labor all your life."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have," replied Jack; "I have done
nothing but lift heavy iron for a good many
years, and now I want to find an easier way
of making a living."</p>

<p>"You have come to the right place to find
it. Step this way."</p>

<p>The student led the way around the room,
passing close to the scholars, some of whom
merely glanced up, others paying not the least
attention to them, until he opened a door and
ushered them into a private office. He introduced
the boys as persons who had come there
to see the "boss mechanic," and then went
out; while a pleasant-faced, elderly gentleman
replied that he was the "boss mechanic" of
that school, and asked them what they wanted.
Jack, who had made a blunder by the first
question he asked, remained silent, leaving
Julian to do all the talking.</p>

<p>"We want to get an education," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Well, that is what this school can give
you," said the man. "What do you want to
study?"</p>

<p>"Stenography and type-writing."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>"And you?" he added, turning to Jack.</p>

<p>"Bookkeeping and writing; I write a fearful
hand."</p>

<p>The superintendent, having made a start
with the boys, invited them to sit down, and
in a few minutes he learned something of the
boys' history, and what occupation they had
been engaged in previous to coming to Denver.
Without telling him anything of their
circumstances, they chanced to mention the
names of Mr. Fay and Mr. Gibson, and after
that Julian thought he seemed to take more
interest in them. After a little conversation
the boys pulled out their roll of bills and paid
for six months' instruction and the books they
would need, and then arose to go, after telling
him they would be on hand in the morning,
ready to go to work.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what's a fact," said Jack,
pausing on the stairs and pulling out his diminished
roll of bills; "we will have to go
to the bank and get some more money, the
first thing you know."</p>

<p>"That is so," replied Julian. "And I have
just thought of another thing. Did you see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
how neatly all those students were dressed?
I am going to draw two hundred dollars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Man alive!" said Jack, appalled by the
sum mentioned. "Suppose Mr. Haberstro
comes up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't bother my head about him. We
will go and get some money, and then we will
go to a tailor's and get some clothes worth
having. If Mr. Haberstro is going to appear,
Mr. Gibson will show us the way out."</p>

<p>Jack was not convinced by any means, but
he kept close by Julian's side until he reached
the bank. Julian made out the check for him
and he signed his name, and the money was
paid to each of them without a word of protest.
Jack felt a little uneasy after that. He
did not like to have so much money about
him. He carried his left hand in the pocket
where he had placed the bills, and looked
at every roughly-dressed man he met, as if he
were afraid that somebody would rob him.</p>

<p>"I don't feel exactly right," said he to Julian.
"As soon as we get home I'll put this
money in my trunk, and then I know it will
be safe."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't keep your hand on it all the while,
or you will lead somebody to suspect something,"
said Julian. "Now, here is a tailor
shop; let us go in and see what we can do."</p>

<p>Jack fairly gasped when Julian said he
wanted the finest suit of clothes there was in
the store. He wanted two suits&mdash;one for every
day and one for Sundays. Of course the
merchant was eager to show them to him, and
the result was that he ordered the best suits
he had ever had in his life. Jack did not believe
in expensive clothes, but Julian urged
it upon him, telling him that he would look
as though he came from the country among
all those nicely-dressed students, and Jack
finally yielded to him.</p>

<p>"That's the worst expenditure of money
that I was ever guilty of," said he, when they
were fairly on the street.</p>

<p>"Grumbling again, are you?" was Julian's
comment. "Never mind; you will get used
to it after a while."</p>

<p>The next thing the boys had in view was
to join the Young Men's Christian Association,
so that they could get some books to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
home with them; and when that was done
they considered themselves settled for the
winter. They went to school the next day,
and from that time until spring opened they
never missed a lesson. Jack was rather awkward
at first. The hands which had been in
the habit of lifting heavy bars of iron could
not accommodate themselves to a pen very
readily; and oftentimes, when Julian sat in
his room, of nights, reading, Jack was there
learning to write. No two boys ever behaved
themselves better than they did, and it was
not long before they became favorites, both
with the boarders and others who came there
to visit. Jack soon got used to his fine clothes,
and wore them as if he had been accustomed
to them all his life. They took an evening
now and then to call upon Mr. Banta, and
they always found him as talkative as ever.
Sometimes they became so interested in his
tales of life in the gold-camps that it was ten
o'clock before they returned home. Mr. Fay
and Mr. Gibson also came in for visits occasionally,
and once the latter took out a bundle
of papers, which he handed to Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"What are these?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They are your property," said the lawyer.
"You can keep the papers yourself, or
you can let me keep them, and I will put
them in my till in the bank."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that all comes to us?" inquired
Julian, while a thrill shot all through
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; the court decided so a week
ago."</p>

<p>"Jack," said Julian, turning to his companion,
"are you sorry, now, that I went to
the express office and invested in that 'old
horse'?"</p>

<p>Jack could not say anything. He remembered
how he had scolded Julian for that,
and he did not want it thrown up to him so
often. Julian then went on and told Mr.
Gibson what had happened in their room the
night he brought the "old horse" home, and
the lawyer laughed loudly at his description
of it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gibson, we really wish you would
take charge of this matter for us," said Julian.
"You hope so, too&mdash;don't you, Jack?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course; we don't know what to do
with it."</p>

<p>And so the matter was settled, and the boys
breathed a good deal easier while they were
on their way home. There was one thing
that often came into their minds, and that
was, What had become of Claus and Casper
Nevins? Had they given up all hopes of
gaining possession of that hundred thousand
dollars? Jack scouted the idea. Casper
might have given it up, but Claus would
stick to his idea until he got into jail by it.
He was not a man who gave up so easily. It
is true they had not seen anything of him
since they came to Denver, but Jack was
sure they would hear from him at some other
time.</p>

<p>"You will see," exclaimed Jack, when he
confided his opinions to Julian. "You want
to be on the watch, or the first thing you
know he will jump down on us."</p>

<p>"I guess Mr. Gibson can shut him up very
easily," said Julian.</p>

<p>"Yes; but it may happen when Mr. Gibson
is not around."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh? Do you mean that he will come
down on us while we are up at the mine?"</p>

<p>"Such things as that have happened.
When you see a German you want to look
out."</p>

<p>Things went along in Denver as they usually
did, and when winter fairly opened on
them the boys thought they had never experienced
such cold weather before. But it did
not interfere with their business in any way.
It was not long before Mr. Banta began to
talk to them about the things that would be
necessary for them to have if they were going
to operate their mine successfully, and the
boys had a lengthy list of things they would
have to buy. They thought they could get
along without some of them, but Banta assured
them that everything they had down
would be of use to them sooner or later. As
time wore on, the prospect of leaving Denver
and going off to the mountains alone, where
they were destined to encounter some risks
that they did not know whether they could
stand up against or not, made the boys silent
and thoughtful. In Denver they had friends&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
were sure of that; but when they got
out to their mine they would be left all to
themselves, and Julian and Jack did not
know what they would make of it. Jack had
less to say about it than his companion, but it
was plain enough to see that he was not going
to back out.</p>

<p>"I tell you I hate to go away and leave all
the kind friends we have gathered about us,"
said Julian, as they left Salisbury's hotel
after Mr. Banta had told them that by two
weeks from Monday they must be on hand
bright and early, all ready to start for the
mountains. "I wish I knew what was in
that mine."</p>

<p>"So do I; and the only way we can find
out is to go and see," replied Jack. "I don't
believe in ghosts, but I have heard so much
about the things up there in that mine that I
am almost ready to give in to them."</p>

<p>There was another thing that Jack thought
of, although he did not mention it. Julian
had always been one of the first to talk about
going to the mine, and he was ready to accuse
Jack of cowardice; but when the time for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
their departure drew near, Julian did not
open his mouth. Jack thought of that, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Banta told them, finally, that they had
better go to work and get their things ready,
and they set about it in earnest. The first
thing they did was to take leave of the students
at the college. The boys were all sorry
to see them go, and the superintendent said
he hoped Julian and Jack had given up the
idea of a gold-mine, for they were getting on
so rapidly in their studies that he trusted to
see them complete the course. He predicted
they would come back poorer than when they
went away. He had heard of such things
before; and, after the young men had eaten
up all their provisions, they would be glad to
find somebody to grub-stake them back to
Denver.</p>

<p>"You will see us back here in the fall,"
said Julian, confidently. "We are not going to
give up our chances of learning something."</p>

<p>"But you may meet your death up there,"
said the superintendent. "I have often heard
of such things."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>"I was awfully afraid you were going to
say something about the ghosts in our gold-mine,"
said Jack, as they went down the
stairs. "You looked at me several times
as though you wanted to say something
about it."</p>

<p>"It was right on the end of my tongue,"
said Julian, "but I thought I had better keep
still about it. If we should come back here
before fall, they would say right away that
we had been frightened out and dared not go
back."</p>

<p>Mr. Banta was busy getting his own things
together, but he found time now and then to
overlook the boys' expenditures. Under his
instructions they bought three horses,&mdash;two
of them for riding, the other intended as a
pack-horse to carry their utensils,&mdash;and then
he led the boys away to a gun-shop, where
they were to purchase rifles.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Banta," said Julian; "we
don't need anything in here. We have got a
revolver apiece, and, if the truth must be told,
we have spent a good deal of time in practicing
with them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"What good will a revolver do you?"
asked Banta, greatly surprised. "If we
chance to meet any Indians&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you told us there were no Indians,"
said Julian. "We don't want to shoot at
anybody unless they are close at hand.
Maybe they will come in handy on the
ghosts, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't know anything about the
plains&mdash;I can see that, plain enough. If you
think revolvers are going to do you, why, I
am done with you."</p>

<p>"Then we have purchased everything we
want, have we?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Be on hand on Monday morning,
because we shall be off before the sun
gets an hour high."</p>

<p>The boys drew a long breath when they
heard this. If they had not talked so much
about visiting their mine it is probable that
both of them would have backed squarely out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>WATERSPOUTS AND BLIZZARDS.</h3>

<p>"Hi! Nellie; get on, there! Strike a
trot! We won't get to the mountains
in seven years, at this gait."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Banta who spoke, and he emphasized
his remarks by making the whip he
carried in his hand crack loudly. The old,
white bell-mare pricked up her ears and
slowly quickened her pace, closely followed
by all the pack-mules and horses belonging to
the train.</p>

<p>"That old pack-mare knows where we are
going as well as we do," said Banta, squaring
around and throwing his leg over the horn of
his saddle so that he could face the two boys
whom he was addressing. "She has been up
here so often that she knows every foot of the
way. If we get hard up for deer meat, all we
have to do is to take her bell off, and then we
can go twenty miles out on the prairie, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
she will bring us back home again. You
can't get lost if you are on her."</p>

<p>"Why do you take the bell off when you
want to go hunting with the mare?" asked
Julian of Mr. Banta, who, by reason of his
age and experience, acted as leader of the
company. "Does the noise of the bell
frighten the game?"</p>

<p>"That is one reason," replied Banta; "and
the other is, we don't want all the pack-mules
and horses to follow us. Wherever they hear
the bell, they will go to it. If we were on
the other side of a wide river, even though it
was swimming-deep, and some of these mules
don't like water any too well, and should
sound that bell a few times, they would all
come over. If anything should happen to
that old bell-mare, and she should die, we'd
send a man on with that bell, and the mules
would follow him wherever he went."</p>

<p>It was Monday morning, and the sun was
just rising. The cavalcade had been on its
way for two hours, for they left the hotel,
amid wishes for good luck from all who saw
them go, at the first peep of day. They went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
directly past the hotel at which Julian and
Jack had stopped to eat dinner when they
first came there, and were now alone in the
foothills which arose on all sides of them.
There were at least a dozen miners in the
company, and they had all set out for Dutch
Flat in the hope of digging up a fortune before
the winter's storms overtook them. Julian
and Jack were there, dressed in rough
miners' clothing, and the horse which bore
their provisions and tools was with the others
who were following the bell-mare.</p>

<p>Anybody could see at a glance that these
boys were tenderfeet, and they did not attempt
to deny it. Every other miner had a
heavy Winchester slung at his back, while
the only firearms the boys exhibited were
Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers, which they carried
strapped to their waists. They did not
look forward to the future with as brave
hearts as most of the miners did. They could
not get the idea out of their minds that the
gold they wanted to find was protected by
something which they did not want to see.
The miners now and then cast curious looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
at them, to see if they were not afraid of the
prospect before them, but finally came to the
conclusion that the boys were "going through
with it." The miners were happy, and sang
rude songs and cracked jokes with each other;
but the boys were busy with their own
thoughts, and took no part in what was going
on around them.</p>

<p>"And I don't blame them, either," said one
miner, in a low voice, to his companion. "I
wouldn't take any part in the singing if I
were in their place. They are brave enough
now, but wait until they have been up to that
mine about two days; then we will see them
at our camp, frightened to death."</p>

<p>"Banta has rather taken them under his
care, judging by the way he keeps watch over
them," said the other miner.</p>

<p>"Yes; he was made acquainted with them
by some high man in Denver, and so he keeps
an eye on them. But he can't go up to their
mine with them. More than that, those
ghosts will not stop for him or anybody else."</p>

<p>Julian and Jack were not accustomed to
being in the saddle from daylight until dark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and the ride was long and wearisome to them.
They stopped at noon to eat their lunch and
to let their animals crop the grass for a few
minutes; but their packs were never removed
from them until they halted for the night at
a place which showed that there had been a
camp before. Lean-to's were scattered around,
partly unroofed by the storms of winter, and
remnants of fires were to be seen; and Banta
said that no one had been there since he and
his party made the camp last fall.</p>

<p>"We made this camp while we were going
down to the city," said he. "It was raining
when we stopped here, and that accounts for
the lean-to's. We had a waterspout that
night, this little stream was filled twenty feet
deep, and some of us began to look wild."</p>

<p>"A waterspout?" queried Jack. "What is
that?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know that I can describe it
so that you can understand it," answered
Banta, scratching his head. "It is caused by
the large quantity of water that sometimes
falls among the hills up-country, and when it
all rushes into these ravines&mdash;well, you can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
imagine how it looks, but I cannot describe it.
This stream has not much water in it now&mdash;you
can step across it anywhere; but I have
seen it bank full from rains in the up-country,
while there was not a drop of it fell here. I
remember that night. I was sound asleep in
a lean-to. I had told the boys that before
morning we would have to get farther up the
bank or run the risk of having some of our
things carried off, and about midnight I awoke
with a feeling that there was something going
on. You don't know anything about that,
do you? Well, you wait until you have
acted as guide for two or three mule-trains,
and then you'll know it. Everything depends
upon you to see that the train comes
out all right.</p>

<p>"I could not go to sleep again when once I
woke up, and so I arose and went out. It
was still raining heavily, but the brook didn't
show much sign of it. I placed myself on
the edge of the bank, and hardly had I got
there before a long, creamy wave, which extended
clear across this gully, crept with a
hissing sound across the sand and rocks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Following with equal speed, and about a hundred
feet behind it, was another wave, an unbroken
mass of water at least five feet in
height. It was not rounded into a wave, as
at sea or on the lakes, but rose sheer and
straight, a perfect wall of water. I knew
that in five minutes this little creek would be
brim full, so I raised a yell and awoke everybody
in camp. The men I had with me were
all veterans, and there was no need that I
should explain matters. They took just one
look at the water, and then grabbed their
things and made a rush for the high bank
behind the lean-to's. After placing them
where they would be safe, they came back
and made a rush for the horses. Pete, there,
caught the bell-mare, and by dint of pulling
and boosting we finally got them to that level
spot you see up there."</p>

<p>Mr. Banta pointed to the bank, which
seemed almost as straight as the side of a
house, and the boys looked on with perfect
astonishment.</p>

<p>"How in the world did you get the mules
and horses up there?" inquired Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"A man can do a heap of things when he
is working for his life and for things that he
can't afford to lose," said Banta, with a laugh.
"Pete has a heap of strength in those arms
of his, and when I get hold of a mule's tail
and begin to twist it, he goes somewhere as
soon as he can. We got them up easy enough,
and there we stayed for two whole days, until
the water had all passed away. We didn't
lose so much as a pound of bacon. But if I
had been asleep, like the rest of the fellows
were, we would have had a time of it; somebody
would have had to swim for his life, and
the current ran like lightning, too."</p>

<p>"I did not know you had to look out for
water on the plains," remarked Julian. "Is
there anything you don't stand in fear of out
here? You see, we want to know it all."</p>

<p>"Well, a waterspout is one thing, and a
blizzard is the next," said Banta. "I mean a
blizzard where the clouds send down chunks
of ice at you as big as your fist. Oh, you
needn't laugh. Look at that."</p>

<p>Banta stripped up his leggings, and showed
the boys a long, ragged scar which he had received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
in one of the commotions of nature referred
to. The wound must have been a dangerous
one.</p>

<p>"And the worst of it was, I did not have a
doctor look at it for two weeks," Banta went
on. "You see, I was out alone, and making
the best track I could for the fort. The sky
had all along been hazy, and on this day I had
to go across the Twenty-mile desert, where
there was not a willow-twig big enough for me
to get under. When I was about half-way
over it began to rain, and in less than an hour
afterward the blizzard came a-ripping. My
horse and mule were made so frantic by the
pelting of the ice that I finally let them go;
but before I released the horse I took my
knife and cut the saddle and blankets off him.
What did I do that for? Because I was too
cold to use my fingers. I settled down there
on the prairie, put the saddle and blankets
over my head, and waited for the storm to
cease; but before I did that, there came a big
bunch of ice and struck me on the leg. I
never had anything hurt so bad in my life."</p>

<p>"How long did you have to stay there?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
asked Jack. "I hear that some of these storms
last two or three days."</p>

<p>"This one lasted one day, and I was glad
to see the ice quit dropping. I was thirty
miles from the fort, and I'll bet I didn't do
two miles of walking in all that distance. I
left everything except my weapons and
crawled all the way. This is the saddle, right
here."</p>

<p>"I should keep that for the good it had
done," said Julian. "Your saddle probably
saved your life."</p>

<p>"It will stay with me while I live," said
Banta, casting an affectionate look upon the
article in question. "Now, boys, suppose you
get ready and chop some wood and start the
fire. I'll take the things off the animals and
straighten up the lean-to. You boys don't
know how to make a lean-to, do you? If you
take a good look at this one, you will see how
it is done."</p>

<p>There was one satisfaction the boys had in
listening to Mr. Banta's stories&mdash;they were
true, every word of them. If any of the
"boys" tried to make things different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
what they were, Banta always shut them up.
That was the reason the boys thought so much
of him, and anything he had to say in regard
to working their mine was always listened to
with the keenest interest.</p>

<p>The change that a few experienced men
made in that deserted camp in a short time
was wonderful. Every stroke of the axe
counted for something, and every step the
men made to and from the places they had
chosen to make their beds seemed to count for
something else; so that by the time Julian
and Jack had cut wood enough to last them
all night the lean-to's were covered with fresh
boughs, those who did not choose to sleep
under shelter had their beds made up under
the protecting branches of trees, the animals
were staked out, and two of the cooks were
busy getting supper. It was all done without
the least commotion, for each man knew what
his duty was.</p>

<p>"If a rain-storm was coming up you
couldn't have made this camp quicker," said
Julian. "It beats the world how soon men
can get ready for the night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but that comes from experience, you
know," said Banta. "Do you know that I
have been thinking of something? When we
get up to Dutch Flat, and you get ready to
go up to your mine, I believe I will go with
you."</p>

<p>"That's the best piece of news I have heard
for a long time," declared Julian, who was delighted
beyond measure. "We don't ask you
to go down in the mine, you understand, but
if you will just stay there until we get things
fixed you will confer a great favor upon us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess I had better see to your wants
a little," said Banta. "You are tenderfeet,
you have never lived alone in the mountains,
and perhaps I can tip you a wink now and
then that will be of use to you. You will need
the mine cleared away&mdash;it has all grown up to
grass by this time&mdash;and you will need a windlass
and a lean-to; and maybe I can be of assistance."</p>

<p>"I know you can; and of great assistance,
too. I tell you, I feel easier. I have often
wondered how that mine looked, and how we
were going to get it in shape to work it, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
don't worry about it now. We are much
obliged to you for your offer."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. I remember that I
was a boy myself, and any such little help as
I have offered you would have been a regular
blessing to me. Now let us go and see if
supper is ready."</p>

<p>Supper was almost ready, and the neat
manner in which it was served up, and the
way it was cooked, told the boys that if the
miners could always get such food as that,
they could work their claims to the best possible
advantage.</p>

<p>"Can we help you a little?" said Julian to
one of the cooks after the meal was over and
the man began gathering up the dishes.</p>

<p>"What a-doing?" asked the cook.</p>

<p>"We want to help you wash the dishes,"
said Julian.</p>

<p>"Why, bless you, that's no trouble. There
is only one way you can help us, and that is
by sitting by and looking on. I never yet
saw a tenderfoot that didn't get in the way.
You will have enough of it to do when you
get up to that ghost-haunted mine of yours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
and have to cook your own meals. You had
better take my advice," said the cook, in a
lower tone, "and stay down on Dutch Flat
with us. There are no spirits down there."</p>

<p>"But it is ours, and I don't see why we
can't work it," replied Julian. "If there is
anybody there, we will make him show himself."</p>

<p>"You will see," said the cook, going to the
camp-fire for a bucket of water. "The next
time we see you, you will be all ready to go
back to Denver."</p>

<p>The cook struck up a whistle as he began
washing the dishes, and the boys, taking this
as a gentle hint that he would rather be
alone, walked off to another fire which had
been kindled in the upper end of the camp.
All the miners were gathered about there, and
each one of them had a story to tell about
some wonderful "find" which he had almost
struck, and then ceased digging because he
was discouraged by the way the gold "showed
up." Banta was there, and after relating
three or four stories of his own, he began to
stretch and yawn as though he were sleepy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
and finally arose and went into his lean-to.
The boys followed him, hoping he would say
something more about going up to their mine
with them; but he talked on other topics
until he got into bed, and then he became
silent. He had already decided what he
would do when they reached Dutch Flat, and
there the matter ended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE CAMP AT DUTCH FLAT.</h3>

<p>The boys slept as comfortably as if they
had been at home in their boarding-house.
It is true their blankets were rather
hard, and their pillows were not as soft as
they might have been, being simply their
saddles with nothing but the horse-blankets
over them, but they never knew a thing from
the time they went to bed until they heard
Mr. Banta's voice roaring out "Catch up!"</p>

<p>They found all in the camp busy. Some
were raking the embers of the fire together,
others were getting ready to cook breakfast,
but most of them were engaged in packing
the animals. This last was a task that the
boys always wanted to see, for the operation
was so complicated that they did not think
they could ever learn how to do it. The
mules were blinded, in the first place, so that
they could not kick when the heavy pack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
was thrown upon their backs, and the man
on the near side, who seemed to "boss" the
business, placed his foot against the mule's
side and called lustily for the rope which the
other fellow held in his hands.</p>

<p>"You have more rope there, and I know
it," was the way in which he began the conversation.</p>

<p>"Here you are," said his companion, and
the rope was passed over the pack to where
the other fellow was waiting to receive it.</p>

<p>"Come, let's have a little more rope," repeated
the first man.</p>

<p>"There's oceans of it here, and you can
have all you want of it."</p>

<p>"Are you all fast there?"</p>

<p>"I will be in a minute. Here's your end."</p>

<p>"All fast here. Now let us see him kick
it off," said the first man; whereupon a dexterous
twist tore off the blinders, and the
mule was free to go and join his companions.
It was all done in two minutes, and the pack
was safe to last until the train halted for the
night.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," said Mr. Banta, turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
to Julian and Jack, who stood, with towel and
soap in their hands, watching the operation of
packing the animals. "You must get around
livelier than this. When you get to digging
out gold by the bucketful you won't wait to
wash your faces or get breakfast; you'll be
down in that mine before the sun is up."</p>

<p>"Are we not going to eat at all?" asked Julian,
who was amused at the man's way of telling
them that they would be so anxious to find
the gold that they would not spend time to
cook their meals.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you will have to eat sometimes,
but you will hold your grub in one
hand and use the spade with the other."</p>

<p>The miners were in a hurry, now, to resume
their journey, and it took them about half as
long to eat breakfast as they devoted to their
supper. Five minutes was about the time they
applied themselves to their meal, and when
Mr. Banta arose from his seat on the ground
and drew his hairy hand across his mouth to
brush away the drops of coffee that clung to
his mustache the miners all arose, too. In less
time than it takes to tell it they were all in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
their saddles and under way, and when they
stopped again for the night they were in a
camp which they had occupied on the way
down to Denver. Mr. Banta was as talkative
as usual, and when he had got his pipe going,
and had taken three or four puffs to make
sure that it was well started, he began his
round of stories, which the boys were always
ready to listen to.</p>

<p>They were all of a week in making their
journey; and about three o'clock in the afternoon,
when the old bell-mare struck a trot,
Mr. Banta turned to Jack and gave him a
poke with his finger.</p>

<p>"We are almost home," said he, joyfully.
"I don't suppose this will seem like home to
you, but it does to me, for it is the only home
I have."</p>

<p>"Do you never get tired of this business?"
asked Julian. "I should think you would
like to go back to the States, where you belong."</p>

<p>"How do you know that I belong in the
States?" asked Mr. Banta.</p>

<p>"I judge by your way of talking, as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
as anything. You were not raised in this
country&mdash;I am certain of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I will go back when I get enough."</p>

<p>"How much do you call enough?"</p>

<p>"Half a million dollars."</p>

<p>Julian and Jack opened their eyes and
looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I've got three hundred thousand now in
the bank at Denver."</p>

<p>"Then you are not so badly off, after all.
I think I could live on the interest of that
much."</p>

<p>"There are some objections to my going
back," said Mr. Banta, looking off toward the
distant mountains. "When I get back there
I will have to settle down to a humdrum life,
and there won't be nothing at all to get up a
little excitement. Here the thing is different.
We live here, taking gold in paying quantities
all the time, and the first thing we know
we hear of some new placers, which have been
found somewhere else, that make a man rich
as fast as he can stick a shovel into the
ground. Of course we pack up and go off to
find the new placers. We have a muss or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
two with some outlaws, and when we get rid
of them we go to work and find out that there
is nothing there."</p>

<p>"Then you wish yourself back at Dutch
Flat," said Jack.</p>

<p>"That's the way it happens, oftentimes. It
is the excitement that keeps us a-going.
Now, in the States I would not have any of
that."</p>

<p>"Did you find many outlaws in this country
when you first came here?"</p>

<p>"They were thicker than flies around a
molasses barrel," answered Mr. Banta. "But
we have got rid of them all, and your life is
just as safe here as it would be in St. Louis.
Whenever we go to a new country, the outlaws
are the first things we look out for.
There's the camp, all right and tight, just as
we left it."</p>

<p>The camp covered a good stretch of ground;
but then Mr. Banta had not told them that
there were fully two hundred miners in it,
and of course such a multitude of men, where
nobody owned the land, would spread over a
good deal of territory. The boys had a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
opportunity to take a survey of the first
mining camp they had ever seen. They were
surprised at the neatness of it. Things in the
shape of old bottles or tin cans were not scattered
around where somebody would stumble
over them, but such articles were thrown into
a ravine behind the camp, out of sight. The
most of the miners had erected little log
cabins to protect them from the storms of
winter, and the others had comfortable lean-to's
which served the same purpose. Most of
the men were busy with their mines, but there
were three or four of them loafing about, and
when the noise made by the pack-animals
saluted their ears they turned to see who was
coming. One glance was enough; they
pulled off their hats and waved them by way
of welcome.</p>

<p>"Well, if here ain't Banta!" they all exclaimed
in a breath. "Did you drop your
roll down at Denver and come back to get
more?"</p>

<p>"Nary a time," replied Mr. Banta, emphatically.
"We got just what we could
eat and drink, and that is all the money we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
spent. Who has passed in his checks since I
have been gone?"</p>

<p>(This was a miner's way of asking "Who's
dead?")</p>

<p>"None of the boys who are here shovelling
for gold," said the man, coming forward to
shake hands with Mr. Banta, "but those four
outlaws who came up here from Denver to
deal out some whiskey and start a faro bank
could tell a different story, if they were here."</p>

<p>"They did not get a foothold here, did
they?" asked Mr. Banta.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they didn't. We hardly gave
them time to unpack their goods before we
jumped on them and spilled their traps on
the ground. One of the bums grew huffy at
that, and he took a wounded arm down for
the doctor to bandage up."</p>

<p>"Have any of the boys made their pile?"</p>

<p>"Some have, and some have not. Tommy
Moran has struck a vein with sixty thousand
dollars in it, and has been loafing around for
the last two months, doing nothing. He
went out to-day to see if he can get some
more. He wants to go home, now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not think he would like to
travel between here and Denver with that
amount of money about him," said Mr.
Banta.</p>

<p>"Well, there will be plenty more to join in
with him when he is ready to go. The discouraged
ones number a heap. The sign
looks right, but the paying-stuff don't pan
out first-rate. Some are going home, and the
rest are going off to hunt up new diggings."</p>

<p>Having briefly got at the news of what had
been going on at the camp while he had been
away, Mr. Banta led the way toward his own
log cabin, which was fastened up just as it
was when he left it. There was one bed,
made of rough boards, an abundance of dishes,
a fireplace, and one or two chairs, and that
was all the furniture to be seen. But Mr.
Banta thought his cabin just about right.</p>

<p>"It don't matter how hard it rains or
blows, this little house has sheltered me for a
year, and has got to do so until my vein gives
out. Now, boys, catch the pack-animals and
turn them over to me, and I'll soon make
things look as though somebody lived here."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>Julian and Jack managed to secure the
pack-animals by catching the bell-mare and
leading her up to the door of the cabin, and
it was not long before the bundles which they
had borne for two hundred miles were placed
on the ground, and Mr. Banta was engaged
in carrying the things into his house. He
unpacked all the bundles except the one that
belonged to the boys, and that would not be
opened until they reached their mine.</p>

<p>"Are you fellows decided on that matter
yet?" he asked. "Had you not better stay
with us here on the Flat? We will promise
you that no spooks will trouble you here."</p>

<p>"The more you talk about that mine, the
more determined we are to see what is in it,"
answered Jack. "You need not think you
can scare us out in that way."</p>

<p>"I like your pluck, and if you are determined
to go there, why, I am going with you.
It is only five miles, and we can easily ride
over there in two hours."</p>

<p>"Where is it you are going?" asked one of
the miners, who stood in the doorway unobserved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>"You know that haunted mine, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Great Moses! You ain't a-going up
there!" said the man; and as he spoke he
came into the cabin and sat down in one of
the chairs.</p>

<p>"The boys are going there, and I thought
I would go with them to see them started,"
said Mr. Banta. "The mine is all grown up
to grass, because there hasn't been anybody
up there for some time now."</p>

<p>"No, I should say not!" exclaimed the
miner, as soon as he had recovered from his
astonishment. "Are the boys plumb crazy?
I tell you, lads, when you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tony, shut your mouth!" cried Mr.
Banta. "The boys won't see anything, but
they'll hear something that will take all the
sand out of them. I have talked to the boys
many times about that mine, during the past
winter, but they have their heads set on it, and
I don't see any other way than to let them go."</p>

<p>"Well, if we hear anything, there must be
something that makes the noise," asserted
Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be something that you can't see,"
said the miner, shaking his head and looking
thoughtfully at the ground. "Two fellows
went up there since I knew the mine, and
when they got down to the bottom of the pit
they were so frightened that they came down
here as fast as they could and struck out for
Denver. They were both big, stout men, and
were armed with Winchesters and revolvers.
If they had seen what made the noise, they
would have been apt to shoot&mdash;wouldn't
they?"</p>

<p>"I should think they would," answered
Jack.</p>

<p>"Will you go down into the mine when
you get there?" asked the man, turning to
Mr. Banta.</p>

<p>"Not much, as anybody knows of," declared
the latter, shivering all over. "The
ghosts don't bother anybody working at the
top, so I shall get along all right."</p>

<p>"Well, that puts a different look on the
matter," remarked Tony, evidently much relieved.
"Then I shall expect to see you
back in two or three days."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I'll be back by that time," asserted
Mr. Banta; and he added to himself, "if anything
happens to the boys after that, why, I
shall be miles away."</p>

<p>This was the first time that Mr. Banta had
anything to say to the miners about what he
intended to do when he reached Dutch Flat,
but it was all over the camp in less than five
minutes. The miner went slowly and thoughtfully
out of the cabin, as if he did not know
whether it was best to agree to his leader's
proposition or not, and it was not long before
the men who were busy with things about
their houses came up in a body to inquire
into the matter. They were filled with astonishment;
and, furthermore, they were anxious
to see the boys who were going to take
their lives in their hands and go up to work
that pit, from which strong men had been
frightened away. And it was so when six
o'clock arrived, and the men all came in to get
their supper. Some of the miners declared
that it was not to be thought of, and some said
that if Mr. Banta was bound to go, they would
go with him to see that he came out all right.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>"You see what the miners think of this
business," remarked Mr. Banta, as he began
preparations for their supper. "They think
you are out of your heads."</p>

<p>"Well, you will not see anything of it, because
you won't go into the mine," said Jack.</p>

<p>"You are mighty right I won't go into the
mine," declared Mr. Banta, looking furtively
about the cabin, as if he expected to see something
advancing upon him. "We will go up
there and put the pit all right, and then you
will have to work it."</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is any gold up there?"
asked Julian.</p>

<p>"There is more gold up there than you
can see in Dutch Flat in a year's steady digging.
The men who have been down in the
mine say so."</p>

<p>"Well, when we come back you may expect
to see us rich," said Julian, compressing
his lips. "And you may be sure that the
spooks won't drive us out, either."</p>

<p>This was all that was said on the subject&mdash;that
is, by those in the cabin; but when the
men had eaten their suppers they all crowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
into it, and the stories that would have been
told of ghosts interfering with miners who
tried to take away their precious belongings
would have tested the boys' courage; but Mr.
Banta did not allow them to go on.</p>

<p>"As I told these boys down at Denver, I
am telling them nothing but facts in regard
to this mine, and I want you to do the same,"
said he. "Don't draw on your imagination at
all."</p>

<p>Before the miners returned to their cabins,
it came about that the boys were going to
have a small army go with them on the morrow.
At least a dozen miners declaimed their
readiness to go with Banta "and see him
through," and Banta did not object.</p>

<p>"The more, the merrier," said he, when
they had been left alone and he turned down
his bedclothes. "Now, you boys can spread
your blankets on the floor in front of the fire
and go to sleep; I will have you up at the
first peep of day."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>THE HAUNTED MINE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Banta kept his word the next
morning, for the day was just beginning
to break when he rolled out on the floor
and gave the order to "Catch up." All the
miners were astir soon afterward; but there
was no joking or laughing going on in the
camp, as there usually was. The men went
silently about their work of cooking breakfast,
or sat smoking their pipes in front of the
fire, for their thoughts were busy with that
mine up in the mountains. Even the talkative
Mr. Banta had nothing to say. He
seemed to have run short of stories, all on a
sudden.</p>

<p>"Say, Julian," remarked Jack, as they
stood by the stream washing their hands and
faces, "why don't Banta talk to us the way he
usually does? I'll bet he is thinking about
what is going to happen to us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p>"I was just thinking that way myself," replied
Julian. "But we have gone too far to
back out; we have got to go on."</p>

<p>"Of course we have. I wouldn't back out
now for anything."</p>

<p>Breakfast was cooked and eaten, and the
same silence prevailed; and that same silence
did more to shake the boys' courage than all
that had been said against their mine. Mr.
Banta answered their questions in monosyllables,
and when he had satisfied his appetite
he put the dishes away unwashed and went
out to catch his horse.</p>

<p>"Take hold of the bell-mare and lead her
up the path," said he, addressing the miners
who were getting ready to accompany him.
"We have to take her and all the stock
along, or the boys' pack-horse won't budge
an inch."</p>

<p>The miners were talkative enough now,
when they saw the boys getting ready to start
on their journey. They crowded around
them, and each one shook them by the hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye! kids," said one. "The next
time I see you, you will be so badly scared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
that you won't be able to tell what happened
to you up there; or, I sha'n't see you at all.
I wish you all the good luck in the world,
but I know that will not amount to anything."</p>

<p>"Do you think they can whip all these
men?" asked Jack, running his eye over the
miners, who were getting on their horses and
making ready to go with Mr. Banta.</p>

<p>"That ain't the thing; you won't see anybody;
but the sounds you will hear when you
get fairly on the floor of that pit you will
never want to hear again."</p>

<p>The bell-mare was caught and led along
the path, the stock all followed after her, and
the miners brought up the rear. Then Mr.
Banta opened his mouth and proceeded to talk
all the way to the mine.</p>

<p>"You boys may come along here pretty
sudden, some time, and if you don't find
Dutch Flat you will stray off into the mountains
and get lost; so I will just blaze the way
for you."</p>

<p>As Mr. Banta spoke he seized a handful
of the branches of an evergreen and pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
them partly off, so that they just hung by the
bark.</p>

<p>"Now, whenever you see that, you are on
the right road," said he; "but if you don't
see it, you had better turn back and search for
a blaze until you find it."</p>

<p>For once the boys did not pay much attention
to Mr. Banta's stories, for their minds
were fully occupied with their own thoughts.
At last&mdash;it did not seem to them that they
had ridden a mile&mdash;the man with the bell-mare
sung out "Here we are!" and led the
way into a smooth, grassy plain which seemed
out of place there in the mountains, and to
which there did not appear to be any outlet
except the one by which they had entered it.
It was surrounded by the loftiest peaks on all
sides except one, and there the plain was
bounded by a precipitous ravine which was so
deep that the bottom could not be seen from
the top. Near the middle of the plain was a
little brook, placed most conveniently for
"washing" their finds, which bubbled merrily
over the stones before it plunged into the
abyss before spoken of; and close on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
side were the ruins of the mine&mdash;a strong
windlass, which had hauled up fifty thousand
dollars' worth of gold&mdash;and the rope that was
fast to the bucket, or rather to the fragments
of it, for the bucket itself had fallen to pieces
from the effects of the weather, and lay in
ruins on the ground. Still farther away stood
the lean-to&mdash;firmly built, of course, but not
strong enough to stand the fury of the winter's
storms. Taken altogether, a miner could
not have selected a more fitting camp, or one
better calculated to banish all symptoms of
homesickness while they were pulling out the
gold from the earth below. Mr. Banta kept
a close watch on the boys, and saw the pleased
expression that came upon their faces.</p>

<p>"I know it looks splendid now, but it will
not look so before long," said he, with a
knowing shake of his head. "Now, boys, let
us get to work. We want to get through
here, so as to get back to Dutch Flat to-night."</p>

<p>The miners unsaddled their horses, grabbed
their axes and spades, and set in manfully to
make the "mine all right," so that the boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
could go to work at it without delay. Some
repaired the lean-to, others laboriously cleared
the mouth of the pit from the grass and brush
which had accumulated there, and still another
brought from the boys' pack the new
bucket and rope which they expected would
last just about long enough for one of them to
go down and up&mdash;and they were positive that
the boy would come up a great deal faster than
he went down. The boys did not find anything
to do but to get dinner, and they were
rather proud of the skill with which the
viands were served up.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you boys could do cooking
like this," said Mr. Banta, as he seated himself
on the grass and looked over the table&mdash;a
blanket spread out to serve in lieu of a cloth.
"If the cooking was all you had to contend
with you could live like fighting-cocks as long
as you stay here."</p>

<p>"We had hardly enough money to pay for
a housekeeper while we were in St. Louis, and
so we had all this work to do ourselves," said
Julian. "You must give Jack the credit for
this. We kept bachelor's hall while we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
at home. He cooked, and I swept out and
helped wash the dishes."</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Mr. Banta, after he had
finished his pipe, "I guess we have Julian
and Jack all ready to go to work whenever
they feel like it. Look over your work, and
see if there is anything you have missed, and
then we will go back to Dutch Flat. I tell
you, I hate to leave you up here in this sort
of a way."</p>

<p>"You need not be," said Jack. "If you
will come up here in two weeks from now, we
will have some gold-dust to show you."</p>

<p>Mr. Banta did not say anything discouraging,
for he had already exhausted all his
powers in that direction. He inspected all
the work, to satisfy himself that it was properly
done, and then gave the order to
"catch up."</p>

<p>"Of course your stock will go back with
us," said he. "You could not keep them here
away from that old bell-mare."</p>

<p>"That was what we expected," said Julian;
"we may be so badly frightened that we won't
think to bring our weapons with us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not afraid to say that I'll risk that,"
said Mr. Banta, leaning over to shake Julian
by the hand. He told himself that the
miner's heart was in that shake. It was very
different from the clasp of the hand that he
gave him when he was first introduced to him
in Denver. "Good-bye, Julian. That is all
I can say to you."</p>

<p>The other miners rode up to take leave of
them, and all looked very solemn. Some
had a parting word to say, and some shook
them by the hand without saying anything,
the man with the bell-mare led off, the stock
followed, the miners came last, and in two
minutes more they were alone. Julian sat
down on the grass feeling lonely indeed, but
Jack jumped up and began to bestir himself.</p>

<p>"Come on, boy&mdash;none of that!" said he,
beginning to gather their few dishes together.
"We must get these things out of the way
and I must get ready to go into that mine."</p>

<p>"Are you going down to-day?" asked Julian.
The time had come at last. For long
months Julian had talked about going down
into that mine&mdash;not boastingly, to be sure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
he had said enough to make people believe
he would not back out, and now the opportunity
was presented for him to do as he had
agreed. "Why can't you let it go until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Because I am just ready to go now," said
Jack; and there was a determined look on his
face which Julian had never seen there before.
"I am fighting mad, now, and to-morrow
I may be as down-hearted as you are."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am afraid?" exclaimed
Julian, springing up and beginning to assist
his chum. "I'll show you that I am not!
If you want to go first you can go, and I will
go the next time."</p>

<p>Julian went to work with a determination
to get the dishes done as soon as possible.
When they had got them all stowed away
where they belonged, Jack stopped to roll up
his sleeves, examined his revolver, which he
strapped to his waist, lighted his lamp, and
led the way toward the mine without saying a
word. Julian gave a hasty glance at him and
saw that his face was as calm as it usually was,
and he began to take courage from that.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>"It looks dark down there, does it not?"
asked Julian, leaning on the windlass and
peering down into the pit.</p>

<p>"It is dark enough now, but it will be
lighter when I get down there with my lamp,"
replied Jack. "Now, Julian, are you sure
you can hold me up?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can. If I can't, we had better
get another man up here."</p>

<p>Jack stopped just long enough to shake
Julian by the hand, then seized the rope and
stepped into the bucket, his partner holding
the windlass so that he would not descend too
rapidly. Slowly he went down, until finally
the bucket stopped.</p>

<p>"All right!" called Jack; and his voice
sounded strangely, coming up from thirty
feet underground. "This hole is bigger
down here than it is at the top. Somebody
has cut away on each side to try to find gold,"
and at last he started off toward the gully.</p>

<p>Julian leaned over the pit and followed his
companion's movements by the light of his
lamp. He saw him as he went around to the
"false diggings," and finally his lamp disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
from view as Jack went down toward
the ravine. His face was very pale; he listened
intently, but could not hear that rustling
of feet nor that moaning sound that had
frightened two men away from there, and his
courage all came back to him.</p>

<p>"I wonder what those men were thinking
of when they started that story about this
mine being haunted?" Julian muttered to
himself. "There is nothing here to trouble
anyone."</p>

<p>Hardly had this thought been framed in
Julian's mind than there came a most startling
and thrilling interruption. The boy was
leaning over the pit with his head turned on
one side, so that he could hear any unusual
sounds going on below, and all of a sudden he
sprang to his feet and acted very much as
though he wanted to go below to Jack's assistance.
He distinctly heard that rustling of
feet over the rocks below, some of them made
by Jack as he ran toward the bucket, and the
other by something else that made Julian's
heart stand still. And with that sound came
others&mdash;moans or shrieks, Julian couldn't tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
which&mdash;until they seemed to fill the pit all
around him. This lasted but a few seconds,
and then came the report of Jack's revolver
and the sound was caught up by the echoes
until it appeared to Julian that a whole battery
of artillery had been fired at once.</p>

<p>"There!" said Julian, greatly relieved to
know that Jack had seen something to shoot
at. "I guess one ghost has got his death at
last!"</p>

<p>A moment afterward came Jack's frantic
pull on the rope, accompanied by his frightened
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pull me up, Julian! For goodness' sake,
pull me up!"</p>

<p>Julian jumped for the windlass and put
every atom of his strength into it. At first
the resistance of the bucket was just about
what it would have been if Jack had stepped
into it; but suddenly the resistance ceased, the
crank was jerked out of his hand, and Julian
was thrown headlong to the ground.</p>

<p>"What was that?" exclaimed the boy, regaining
his feet as quickly as he could.
"Jack, did you fall out of the bucket?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>There was no response to his question. He
leaned over and looked into the pit; but
Jack's light had gone out, and everything
was silent below. The rustling of feet had
ceased, the moans had died away, and the
mine was as still as the grave.</p>

<p>"Something has happened to Jack!" exclaimed
Julian, running to his lean-to after
his revolver and lamp. "I am going down
there to see about it if all the ghosts in the
Rocky Mountains should be there to stop
me!"</p>

<p>Julian worked frantically, and in less time
than it takes to tell it he was ready to go down
to Jack's help. He hastily unwound the rope
until all the length was out except the extreme
end, which was fastened to the windlass by a
couple of staples, and swung himself into the
mine. He went down much faster than Jack
did, and when he reached the bottom he let
go his hold on the rope, and, holding his revolver
in readiness for a shot, he turned slowly
about, as if he were expecting that whatever
had frightened Jack would be upon him before
he could think twice. But nothing came.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
In whatever direction he turned his light,
everything seemed concealed by Egyptian
darkness, and finally he resolved to let the
ghosts go and turned his attention to Jack.
There he lay, close to Julian's feet, his lamp
extinguished and his revolver at a little distance
from him; and it was plain that he was
either frightened or dead, for Julian had
never seen so white a face before. His own
face, if he only knew it, was utterly devoid of
color, and his hands trembled so that he could
scarcely use them.</p>

<p>"I would like to know what it was that
could make Jack faint away in this fashion,"
muttered Julian, first looking all around to
make sure that nothing had come in sight before
he laid his revolver down. "How to get
him into that bucket, and the bail over him,
is what bothers me just now; but he must go
in, and get out of this."</p>

<p>Jack was a heavyweight, and if any boy
who reads this has ever been called upon to
handle a playmate who remained limp and
motionless in his arms he will know what a
task Julian had to put him into the bucket.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
And remember that he must go inside the
bail, otherwise he could not pull him out; and
the bail would not stay up without somebody
to hold it. But Julian worked away as only
a boy can under such circumstances, and was
just getting him in shape, so that in a moment
more he would have had him in, when
he noticed that one of his hands was wet. He
stopped for a moment to look at it, and at the
sight of it he seemed ready to sit down beside
Jack and faint away, too.</p>

<p>"It is blood!" murmured Julian. "My
goodness! you must get out of here, and be
quick about it! What was that?"</p>

<p>Julian straightened up again, but he had
his revolver in his hand. That moaning
sound was repeated again, but the boy could
not tell where it came from. It was not so
great in volume as the first one that had
saluted Jack, but it was a complaining kind
of a sound, such as one might utter who was
being deserted by the only friend he had upon
earth. Julian stood there with his revolver
in his hand, but, aside from the sound which
rung in his ears for many a night afterward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
his eyes could not reveal a single thing for
him to shoot at. Julian thought now that he
had got at the bottom of the mystery. Hastily
slipping his revolver into his belt, he
turned his attention to Jack, and in a few
moments had him ready to hoist to the top.
Then he seized the rope, and, climbing it
hand over hand, he reached the surface, when,
throwing off his hat and revolver, he turned
around to haul up Jack.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>HAUNTED NO LONGER.</h3>

<p>This time Julian laid out all his strength
on the windlass; but the bucket resisted,
and he knew that Jack's weight was safely
within it. Presently his head and shoulders
appeared above the pit, whereupon Julian
slipped a bucket over the crank, and in a few
minutes Jack was safe above ground. To
tumble him out of the bucket and dash into
his face some water that he dipped up from
the stream with his hat occupied but little of
his time, and almost at once Jack opened his
eyes and looked about him.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you saw them, did you not?"
asked Julian, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I tell you, you wouldn't have smiled if
you had been in my place," replied Jack.
"That thing looked awful as it came at me."</p>

<p>"What thing?"</p>

<p>"There is some animal down there who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
not going to let us work this mine if he can
help it," said Jack, feeling around with his
right hand to examine his shoulder. "As I
stepped into the bucket with one foot he
jumped&mdash;my goodness! I don't like to say
how far it was; but I saw his eyes shining
green in the darkness, and just as I pulled on
him he sprang at me, dug his claws into my
shoulder, and pulled me out. I thought I was
gone up, sure; then all was blank to me. Did
you see him?"</p>

<p>"I did not see anything," said Julian.
"When the bucket came up easily, as though
you were not in it, I went down after you;
but I did not see a thing. What was it?"</p>

<p>"You tell. It was some kind of an animal
that I never saw before. And didn't he make
a howling just before he jumped! I wish you
would look at my shoulder; it smarts awfully."</p>

<p>Jack could handle himself well enough
now, and it was no trouble for him to roll
over on his face and give Julian a chance to
view his wounds. His shirt was torn completely
off, and underneath were four scratches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
which went the whole length of his back and
spent themselves on the thick waistband of his
trousers, which they had ripped in two. Very
little blood came from the wounds, and Julian
assured him that they were not deep enough
to cause him any inconvenience.</p>

<p>"You must have killed him before he got
to you," said Julian. "A bear could not
jump that far, and if it were a panther&mdash;why,
you have done something to be proud of.
You have done it anyway, for you have
cleared up something that scared those two
men away from here."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"But think of the howling he made! It
seemed as if the pit was full of bears and
panthers, and I didn't know which way to
look. Have you got all the blood off? Then
let us go down there and see about it. We
can't work our mine with those fellows in
there. If I killed him at once, how did he
come to jump so far? And then he took
himself off after clawing me; that is something
I don't understand."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>"You have to shoot one of those fellows
through the brain or in the spine, in order to
throw him in his tracks. Did you have a
fair chance at his heart?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I simply shot a little ways
below that green spot, in the darkness, and
the next thing I knew I didn't know anything."</p>

<p>"Because, if you had a fair chance at his
heart, a wild animal will sometimes run a
good way before he drops. He is down there
somewhere, and I'll bet you will find him.
But, Jack, there are others that we must get
rid of before we own this mine."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that? I was in
hopes I had shot the last one of them."</p>

<p>"Well, you did not. While I was working
over you I heard those moans repeated.
That proves others are there&mdash;don't it?"</p>

<p>"I am going down to clear it up," persisted
Jack, who had got upon his feet by
this time and started toward the lean-to.
"Hold on till I get cartridges to put in this
revolver. I used to grumble at you because
you spent so much money in Denver, last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
winter, in shooting at a mark, but I begin to
believe you were right and that I was wrong.
If I had been as awkward with this shooting-iron
as I used to be, you would have got the
whole of that hundred thousand dollars to
spend for yourself."</p>

<p>"Don't speak about it!" exclaimed Julian,
who wondered what he should do if Jack was
taken away from him. "I need somebody to
grumble at me, and you will do as well as
anybody. Are you not going to put on
another shirt?"</p>

<p>"Not much, I ain't. Maybe I did not kill
that animal, whatever it was and he will come
for me again. Now, you hold up and let me
go," said Jack, when he saw Julian place one
foot in the bucket."</p>

<p>"I am a better shot than you are, and if I
pull on one of those ghosts you will see him
drop," returned Julian, drawing the other
foot in. "Take hold of the windlass and let
me down easy. If I halloo, you must lose no
time in hauling me up."</p>

<p>Jack was obliged to submit to this arrangement,
and he carefully lowered Julian out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
sight. When the bucket stopped he seized
the rope, and in a moment more stood beside
him.</p>

<p>"I am glad it is animals that are interfering
with us, for I am not at all afraid of
them," declared Jack. "Now, where is that
other sound you heard?"</p>

<p>The question had hardly been formed on
Jack's lips when that sound came to their
ears&mdash;not faint and far off, as was the one
that caused Julian to handle his revolver, but
louder and clearer, as though the animal that
made it was close upon them. Sometimes
they thought it was in front, and they held
their revolvers ready to shoot at a moment's
warning, and then, again, it sounded behind
them; and in a second more it appeared as if
the rocks on each side of them concealed
the enemy that was uttering those startling
sounds.</p>

<p>"It is the echo&mdash;that's what it is," said
Julian. "There is only one animal in here,
and we can't shoot him any too quick."</p>

<p>Julian, aided by his lamp, led the way
cautiously along the subterranean passage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
which would have been level but for the carelessness
or haste of the men who had worked
the pit before them, peering into every little
cavity he saw, until at last he stopped suddenly
and pointed his revolver at something
that lay upon the floor.</p>

<p>"What is it, Julian?" whispered Jack,
pressing eagerly to his side.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you have done it now," answered
Julian, bending over and examining
the animal as well as he could by the light of
his lamp. "This is the thing that frightened
the other two men away."</p>

<p>"What is it?" repeated Jack. "A panther?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; this animal will make two of the
biggest panthers you ever saw. It is a lion!"</p>

<p>"In America?" said Jack, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It is what the miners call them, anyway.
When we get it into the bucket I will let you
have the crank, and we will see if it does not
weigh almost as much as you do. This animal
is a mother, and her babies are crying for
her."</p>

<p>Jack was surprised when he saw what a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
monster animal his lucky shot had put out of
the way, for he did not lay any claim to his
skill as a marksman in making that shot. He
must have shot her plumb through the heart,
or else she would not have died so quickly.
She looked as big as a yearling, marked for
all the world like the panthers he had seen in
the shows which he had attended; but it was
her size more than anything else which impressed
him. It was wonderful, too, what a
change the sight of this animal made in Jack.
His courage all came back to him, and after
taking a hasty glance at his trophy he took
the lead and pressed on toward the farther end
of the passage. Every few feet he found what
the miners called "false diggings"&mdash;that is,
places that they had dug, either on the right-hand
side or the left, to see if the vein they
were following turned that way. In one of
these "false diggings" Jack stopped and
pointed silently before him. Julian looked
over Jack's shoulder, and saw that the miner
had dug through the embankment there and
into a cave which extended through into the
gulch&mdash;the boys could see that by the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
streaks of light which came in at the other
end. On a slight shelf which formed one side
of the passageway some leaves had been gathered,
and in this bed were two cubs about the
size of full-grown cats, while a third had
crawled out and was trying, in his clumsy
way, to follow his mother into the mine. The
little thing was wild, and set up a furious spitting
as the boys approached.</p>

<p>"These things account for the noise you
heard," remarked Jack, picking up the cub
and beating its head against the floor.</p>

<p>"What made you do that, Jack?" exclaimed
Julian. "We ought to save the
young ones alive."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose we do; what will we raise
them on? It is true that we might tell the
milkman to leave us an extra quart or two to
feed them on, for such little things can't eat
bacon and hard-tack. Now, after we get
through&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By gracious, Jack&mdash;look out!" exclaimed
Julian, suddenly. "The old man is coming
home to see what's the matter with his young
ones!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p>Jack dropped the cub he had picked up,
and which he was about to serve as he had the
first, and, looking toward the farther end of
the passageway, saw that the light was shut
off by the head and shoulders of another monstrous
lion that had stopped when he discovered
the boys. In an instant two revolvers
were aimed at the white spot on his chest.</p>

<p>"Be sure you make as good a shot as you
did before," whispered Julian, whose face was
as pale as Jack's was when he pulled him out
of the pit. "It's a matter of life and death
with us."</p>

<p>The revolvers cracked in quick succession,
raising an echo that almost deafened them.
Without a moment's delay they fired again,
then threw themselves prone upon the floor
of the cave, for they saw the lion coming. He
had evidently got all ready for a spring, and
when the first two bullets struck him he made
it, jumping over them and landing in the pit
beyond. The moment he touched the ground
two more balls went into him, and then the
boys jumped to their feet; for they did not
want the lion to spring upon them while lying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
down. But the animal made no effort to recover
his feet; he was too badly hurt for that.
He struggled frantically, springing from the
ground as high as the boys' heads, and his
motions were so quick and rapid that there
was no chance to shoot him again; but this
lasted only for a few seconds. His struggles
grew weaker, and he soon lay upon the floor,
stone dead.</p>

<p>"There, sir," said Julian, who was the first
to speak; "this is a haunted mine no longer.
Our little 44-caliber revolvers did as good
work as Banta would have done with his
Winchester."</p>

<p>"Whew! I am glad it is all over, and that
we were not frightened out of coming here. I
don't believe in ghosts, anyway."</p>

<p>"How do you account for that man in the
mine up the country who always gets farther
and farther away every time anybody tries to
touch him?" asked Julian.</p>

<p>"I believe that story originated in the
minds of some miners who were afraid to go
there. And as for their shooting at him, I
don't take any stock in that, either. Now, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
will finish what I was going to say when the
old gentleman came in and interrupted me.
After I have killed these cubs, we will go to
work and fill this cave so full of the rocks
which some of the miners have left scattered
about that there won't be a chance for any
other animal to make a commotion in this
mine."</p>

<p>The work of dispatching the cubs was very
soon accomplished, and then the boys wanted
to get the lions above ground, so that they
could see how they looked. But when they
undertook to lift the "old gentleman," to
carry him to the bucket, they found they had
more than they could do; so they each took
hold of a hind leg and dragged him to the
shaft. When they came to put him in, they
saw there was not room enough for the cubs,
for the bucket would not hold any more.</p>

<p>"I'll go up and haul the old fellow out,"
said Jack. "I tell you, he is big enough to
scare anybody&mdash;is he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Julian, with a laugh;
"and if we had been frightened away, and
somebody else had found out that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
lions, and not unearthly spirits, it would have
been all over Denver inside of a month."</p>

<p>Jack, who said he thought that was so,
seized the rope and began working his way
toward the top. Then the bucket began to
move, and presently Julian saw it go out over
the top. In a few minutes Jack came down
again, and they got the mother of the family
ready to be hoisted up. Julian went up this
time, tumbled the lion out beside his mate,
and let down the bucket for the dead cubs
and Jack, who, when he stepped out, found
Julian with his hat off and drawing his shirt-sleeves
across his forehead.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack, if the dirt you send up
weighs as much as these ghosts did, the one
who pulls it out will have the hardest part of
the work," said Julian. "Now let us sit
down and take a good look at them."</p>

<p>The longer the boys looked, the larger
seemed to grow the animals that had created
so great an uproar in the country for miles
around. They regretted they had not brought
a tape-line with them, that they might take
measurements; but they came to one conclusion&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
they found an animal like either of
those in the mountains, they would give it a
wide berth. They had read of encounters
with them by men, and during their stay in
Denver had listened to some thrilling stories,
told by miners, of their fierceness, and they
decided that those men had more pluck than
they had.</p>

<p>"Let us take the skins off, and by that time
it will be night," said Julian. "We can fill
up the hole to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to go to work at it&mdash;do
you?" asked Jack, taking off his hat and
scratching his head. "I never did such a
piece of business in my life."</p>

<p>"We are not going to take them off with
the intention of selling them; we are going
to show them to the miners. If we tell them
our story without anything to show for it,
they will think we are trying to shoot with a
long bow. If we make a few holes in the
skins by a slip of our knives, who cares?"</p>

<p>The boys went to work on the cubs first,
one holding the hind legs and the other doing
the skinning, and they got along so well with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
them that they went to work on the big ones
with more confidence. By the time it grew
dark the skins were removed, and the carcasses
were dragged away and thrown into the
ravine. Then the boys began supper with
light hearts. The mystery of the haunted
mine had been unearthed, and Julian and
Jack were ready to dig up the treasure&mdash;that
is, if there was any there waiting for them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>"THAT IS GOLD."</h3>

<p>"Jack, come up here; I have something
to show you."</p>

<p>"What is it? Have you made yourself
rich by washing out the last bucket of earth
I sent up?"</p>

<p>"I have something, and it looks like gold.
Wait until I haul this bucket up, and then
I'll send it down for you."</p>

<p>This conversation took place between Julian
and his chum on the third morning after
their arrival at the mine. The hole that led
into the cave which the lions had made their
habitation had been filled up so tight that even
a ground-squirrel would have found it a hard
task to work his way through; all the little
rocks had been cleared away from the floor of
the pit, making it an easy matter for them to
carry the earth in a basket to the bottom of
the shaft, and the digging had been going on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
for two days without any signs of "color"
rewarding their anxious gaze. The buckets
of dirt, as fast as they were sent up, were
washed in the brook by the aid of a "cradle"
which the boys had brought with them, but
their most persistent "rocking" failed to
leave a sediment behind. All the dirt went
out with the water, and the cradle was as
clean when they got through rocking it as it
was before they began.</p>

<p>"I believe the fellow who wrote that letter
must have taken all the gold in the mine," remarked
Julian, one night, after they had
spent a hard day's work at the pit. "Fifty
thousand dollars! That's a heap of money to
take out of one hole in the ground."</p>

<p>"I think so myself," replied Jack; "but
we will keep it up until our provisions are
gone, and then we will go back to Dutch
Flat."</p>

<p>But on this particular day Julian, who was
washing the dirt at the head of the shaft,
thought he saw some settlings in the bottom
of his cradle, and forthwith began to handle
it a little more carefully. The longer he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
rocked the more the sediment grew, until at
last he had a spoonful, which he gathered up
and then approached the mouth of the pit.</p>

<p>"If you have any gold to show me I'll
come up before the bucket does," declared
Jack; "the bucket can wait."</p>

<p>"I have enough here to buy another block
of houses," exclaimed Julian, as Jack's head
and shoulders appeared. "What do you think
of that?"</p>

<p>"Is it gold or not?" asked Jack, who was
inclined to be suspicious. "Maybe it is
some of that iron that Mr. Banta told us
about."</p>

<p>"That is just what I was afraid of," said
Julian; "but I reckon iron pyrites comes in
lumps, don't it? If it does, this is gold, sure
enough."</p>

<p>The boys did not know what to make of it,
and they finally decided that they would put
it away until Mr. Banta came up to see how
they were getting along, which he had agreed
to do at the end of two weeks. The boys
spoke of their "find" as iron pyrites, for they
did not like to think they would be lucky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
enough to dig gold out of the ground, and this
was not the only spoonful of dust that went
into their bag. The bag grew in size as the
days wore on, and finally, at the end of two
weeks, it was almost full.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack, I don't like to show this
to Mr. Banta," declared Julian, holding up
the bag, and looking ruefully at it. "Perhaps
we have done all our best digging all
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped," was Jack's reply.
"They were inexperienced when they
first came out here, and there was nobody to
tell them whether they had iron pyrites or
gold. But we have done one thing that he
can't laugh at&mdash;we have worked the haunted
mine."</p>

<p>Two weeks had never passed so slowly to
the boys before. They worked early and late,
but they found time now and then to glance
toward the entrance of the valley, to see if
Mr. Banta was approaching. All this while
the bag grew heavier and fuller, until Julian
declared that it would not hold another
spoonful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we must tie it up tight and hide it
somewhere," said Jack.</p>

<p>"What is the use of hiding it?" asked Julian.
"Nobody knows that we have been so
successful in our haunted mine."</p>

<p>"No matter; such things have happened,
and we want to be on the safe side. We must
hide it a little way from the lean-to, for there
is the first place anybody will look for it."</p>

<p>Julian readily gave in, although he could
not see any necessity for it, took a spade, and
went with Jack to what he considered to be a
good hiding-place. A hole was dug, the bag
put in, some leaves were scattered over the
spot, and then Jack drew a long breath of
relief.</p>

<p>"One would think we are surrounded by
robbers," said Julian. "Who do you suppose
is going to steal it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I have never had so
much money, or what is equivalent to money,
in my charge before, and, as I said before, I
think it best to be on the safe side."</p>

<p>"Our two weeks have passed, and Mr.
Banta ought to be here to-morrow," observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Julian, leading the way back to the lean-to.
"I expect he will look for us to be all
chawed up."</p>

<p>The very next day Mr. Banta appeared.
The boys had found an extra "find" that
morning. Julian was rocking the cradle back
and forth, and Jack was leaning over his
shoulder to see what gold there was in it, when
they heard the sound of horses' hoofs on the
rocks, and looked up to find the miner and
his partner, Pete, standing in the entrance to
the valley.</p>

<p>"Now we will soon have this thing cleared
up," exclaimed Julian, joyfully. "Mr. Banta,
you don't know how glad we are to see you
again!"</p>

<p>Mr. Banta did not say anything in reply.
He and his partner rode slowly toward them,
looking all around, as if they expected to discover
something.</p>

<p>"Is it the ghosts you are looking for?"
asked Jack. "Come along, and we will show
them to you."</p>

<p>"Boys," stammered Mr. Banta, as if there
was something about the matter that looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
strange enough to him, "you are still on top
of the ground. Put it there."</p>

<p>The boys readily complied, and they
thought, by the squeeze the miner gave their
hands, that he was very much surprised to see
them alive and well, and working their mine
as if such things as ghosts had never been
heard of.</p>

<p>"Did you see them?" he continued.</p>

<p>"You are right, we did," answered Julian.
"Jack, pull off your shirt. He has some
marks that he will carry to his grave."</p>

<p>Jack did not much like the idea of disrobing
in the presence of company, but he divested
himself of his shirt and turned his
back to the miners. On his shoulder were
four big welts, which promised to stay there
as long as he lived.</p>

<p>"It was a lion!" exclaimed Mr. Banta.</p>

<p>"That is just what it was. Now come with
me and I will show you the skins. We have
something to prove it."</p>

<p>The miners followed after the boys, when,
as they were about to pass their pit, Julian
said he wanted to see them about something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
that had been worrying them a good deal ever
since they first discovered it.</p>

<p>"What do you call that?" he asked, gathering
up a pinch of the sediment that still remained
in the cradle.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Do you gather much of
this stuff?" exclaimed Mr. Banta, who was all
excitement now.</p>

<p>"It is not iron pyrites, is it?"</p>

<p>"Iron your grandmother!" retorted Mr.
Banta. "It is gold, and a bag full of that
stuff will be worth about ten thousand dollars
to you!"</p>

<p>"We have a bagful of it hidden away," asserted
Julian; while Jack was so overcome
with something, he didn't know what, that he
sat right down on the ground. "Jack thought
we had best hide it, but I will get it and show
it to you."</p>

<p>"Well, well! this beats anything in the
world that I ever heard of! Don't it you,
Pete?" asked Mr. Banta, dismounting from
his horse. "Here's you two, come out here
as tenderfeet from St. Louis, who never saw
or heard of a gold-mine before, and you come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
up to this pit, which has all manner of ghosts
and other things wandering about it at will,&mdash;so
much so that they scared away two of
the best men we had on Dutch Flat,&mdash;and
then you get the upper hand of the spirits and
make ten thousand dollars out of the mine in
two weeks! I tell you that bangs me; don't
it you, Pete?"</p>

<p>Jack came up to take the horses and hitch
them to swinging limbs, and Mr. Banta turned
to Julian and told him he was anxious to see
that bag with the ten thousand dollars in gold
in it; whereupon Julian caught up a spade
and hurried out, and Jack, who had returned
to the lean-to, was told to sit down and tell
them the story about the haunted gold-mine.</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell," said Jack, who,
like all modest fellows, disliked to talk about
himself. "I went down to see what the inside
of the mine looked like, and one of the lions
pitched onto me and I shot him."</p>

<p>"There's more in the story than that comes
to," declared Mr. Banta. "Let us go out and
look at the skins; we will hear the straight
of the matter when Julian comes in."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>The skins were rolled up,&mdash;they had been
stretched on the ground until the sun dried
them,&mdash;but Jack quickly unrolled them, and
the miners looked on as if greatly surprised.
They could not understand how one ball, fired
in the dark, had finished the lion so speedily.</p>

<p>"It is a wonder she did not tear you all to
pieces," said Pete. "You must have made a
dead-centre shot."</p>

<p>The other skin was unrolled, too, and by
the time the miners had examined it to their
satisfaction Julian came up with the bag.
Mr. Banta untied it, and one look was enough.</p>

<p>"That is gold," said he; "there is no iron
pyrites about that. Now, Jack, you go on
and get dinner for us, and we will listen while
Julian tell us about those ghosts."</p>

<p>"I told you I did not believe in such
things," remarked Julian. "And the whole
thing has come out just as I said it would."</p>

<p>"What have you in this pack?" asked
Jack. "It looks like provisions."</p>

<p>"That is just what it is. We thought you
must be nearly out by this time, and so we
brought some along. Let the mule go home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
if she wants to; she misses that old bell-mare."</p>

<p>The story which Jack did not tell lost
nothing in going through Julian's hands. He
described things as nearly as he could see
them before Jack's light went out, and told
of the lucky shot and the savage shrieks that
came up to him through the pit.</p>

<p>"Those shrieks were what got next to me,"
declared Julian, with a shudder. "I can't
get them out of my mind yet. I thought that
the ghost had Jack, sure."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said Mr. Banta, when Julian
paused. "There were two lions there&mdash;how
did you get the other one?"</p>

<p>When Julian told how Jack had taken
charge of the matter, and had gone ahead in
order to hunt up the other ghost, Mr. Banta
acted as though he could scarcely believe it;
while Pete thrust his spurred heels out before
him and broke out into a volley of such quaint
oaths that Julian threw back his head and
laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"If you had not done anything else since
you have been up here but go to hunt up that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
lion with revolvers, I should know you were
tenderfeet pure and simple," declared Mr.
Banta. "Why, boys, that was the most dangerous
thing you ever did!"</p>

<p>"Well, we did not know what else to do,"
explained Julian, modestly. "Jack said the
lion would not let us work the mine if he
could help it, and so we had to go and find
him."</p>

<p>"I know some miners down at Dutch Flat
who would think twice before going for that
lion with their Winchesters," declared Pete,
"and you had nothing but little popguns!"</p>

<p>"They did the work, anyhow," asserted
Julian.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, you have been very lucky,"
said Mr. Banta. "Take your bag of dust and
hide it where nobody will ever think of looking
for it. And remember&mdash;if any person
comes here and asks you for money, you are
to give him what is in the other bag, and keep
still about this full one."</p>

<p>Julian's eyes began to open wide as this hint
was thrown out. He looked at Jack, who was
by this time engaged in dishing up the dinner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
but the latter only shook his head at him,
as if to say, "Didn't I say we had better hide
that gold while we had the opportunity?"</p>

<p>"Who do you think is going to rob us?"
asked Julian, as soon as he could speak.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know; but we have
some men down at the Flat who would not be
any too good to come up here and see how you
are getting along. Of course this thing will
get all over the Flat in less than five minutes
after we get there. We must tell just how we
found you; for, if we try to keep it secret,
the miners will suspect something and come
up here in a body. But if they do that, then
you will be safer than if you were alone."</p>

<p>"We don't want any truck with such
people," declared Jack. "If we shoot as well
as we did at the lion that wore that big skin,
you will hear something drop. Now sit up
and eat some dinner."</p>

<p>"Jack, I believe you have the most pluck,"
said Pete.</p>

<p>"He has it all," replied Julian. "He don't
say much, but he keeps up a dreadful lot of
thinking."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner over, the miners lit their pipes, and
then Mr. Banta said they wanted to go down
into the mine to see how it looked.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion that you won't get much
more gold out of here," said he, as he stepped
into the bucket. "You are gradually working
your way toward the ravine, and when
you break through the wall, you will find no
color there."</p>

<p>"I don't care," replied Julian. "If it will
hold out until we get another bag filled, that
will be all we want. We can say, when we
get back to Denver, that we have been in the
mines."</p>

<p>"And had some adventures there, too," remarked
Mr. Banta. "Lower away."</p>

<p>Julian and Pete followed Mr. Banta down
to the bottom of the mine, and Jack stayed
up above to manage the bucket. They were
gone a long time, for Julian was obliged to
tell his story over again; and, when they were
pulled up, Mr. Banta repeated what he had
said before he was let down, namely, that the
boys had about reached the end of their vein.</p>

<p>"But even with these bags full, you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
got more than some men have who have been
on the Flat for two years," said he. "Now,
boys, is there anything we can do for you before
we bid you good-bye?"</p>

<p>No, Julian and Jack could not think of
anything they wanted. They thanked the
miners for bringing them some provisions,
and offered payment on the spot; but Mr.
Banta said they would let that go until the
boys had got through working their mine.
They shook them by the hand, wished them
all the good luck in the world, turned their
faces toward home, and in a few moments the
sound of their horses' hoofs on the rocks had
died away in the distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>CLAUS, AGAIN.</h3>

<p>"There!" said Mr. Solomon Claus, as he
entered at a fast walk the railroad
depot, passed through it, and took up the first
back street that he came to; "I guess I have
got rid of him. Now, the next thing is to go
somewhere and sit down and think about it."</p>

<p>Claus kept a good watch of the buildings
as he passed along, and at last saw a hotel,
into which he turned. He bought a cigar at
the bar, and, drawing a chair in front of one
of the windows, sat down to meditate on his
future course; for this German was not in the
habit of giving up a thing upon which he had
set his mind, although he might fail in every
attempt he undertook. He had set his heart
upon having a portion of that money that
Julian had come into by accident, and, although
something had happened to upset his
calculations, he was not done with it yet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>"That was a sharp trick, sending off the
box by express, when they might as well have
carried its contents in their valises," said
Claus, settling down in his chair and keeping
his eyes fastened upon the railroad depot.
"Wiggins was at the bottom of that, for I
don't believe the boys would ever have thought
of it. I wonder how they felt when they
found their valises gone? Now, the next
thing is something else. Shall I go home,
get my clothes, and spend the winter in Denver,
or shall I go home and stay there?
That's a question that cannot be decided in a
minute."</p>

<p>While Claus was endeavoring to come to
some conclusion on these points he saw Casper
Nevins coming along the railroad and entering
the depot. By keeping a close watch of
the windows he discovered him pass toward
the ticket office, where he made known his
wants, and presently Claus saw him put a
ticket into his pocket.</p>

<p>"So far, so good," muttered Claus, as he
arose from his chair. "I guess I might as
well get on the train with him, for I must go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
to St. Louis anyhow. Perhaps something will
occur to me in the meantime."</p>

<p>Casper was sitting on a bench, with his
hands clasped and his chin resting on his
breast, wondering what in the world he was
going to do when he got back to St. Louis,
when he heard Claus's step on the floor. He
first had an idea that he would not speak to
him at all; but Solomon acted in such a
friendly manner, when he met him, that he
could not fail to accost him with</p>

<p>"You were trying to shake me, were you?"</p>

<p>"Shake you! my dear fellow," exclaimed
Claus, as if he were profoundly astonished.
"Such a thing never entered my head! I
simply wanted to get away by myself and
think the matter over. Have a cigar."</p>

<p>"I don't want it!" declared Casper, when
Claus laid it down upon his knee. "I don't
believe I shall want many cigars or anything
else very long."</p>

<p>"Disappointed over not finding that wealth,
were you?" asked Claus, in a lower tone.
"Well, I was disappointed myself, and for a
time I did not want to see you or anybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
else. I have wasted a heap of hard-earned
dollars upon that 'old horse.'"</p>

<p>"Have you given it up, too?" inquired
Casper.</p>

<p>"What else can I do? Of course I have
given it up. I will go back home again and
settle down to my humdrum life, and I shall
never get over moaning about that hundred
thousand dollars we have lost."</p>

<p>"Do you think we tried every plan to
get it?"</p>

<p>"Every one that occurred to me. They
have it, and that is all there is to it. What
are you going to do when you get back to St.
Louis?" inquired Claus, for that was a matter
in which he was very much interested. He
was not going to have Casper hanging onto
him; on that he was determined.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to do as others do
who are without work," replied Casper. "I
shall go around to every store, and ask them
if they want a boy who isn't above doing anything
that will bring him his board and
clothes. I wish I had my old position back;
I'll bet you that I would try to keep it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the best wish you have made in a
long time," said Claus, placing his hand on
Casper's shoulder. "If I was back there,
with my money in my pocket, I would not
care if every one of the express boys would
come and shove an 'old horse' at me. I tell
you, 'honesty is the best policy.'"</p>

<p>Casper was almost ready to believe that
Claus had repented of his bargain, but he soon
became suspicious of him again. That was a
queer phrase to come from the lips of a man
who believed in cheating or lying for the purpose
of making a few dollars by it. For want
of something better to do, he took up the cigar
which Claus had laid upon his knee and proceeded
to light it.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll go and get a ticket,"
remarked Claus, after a little pause. "I don't
know how soon that train will be along."</p>

<p>"'Honesty is the best policy,' is it?"
mused Casper, watching Claus as he took up
his stand in the door and looked away down
the railroad. "Some people would believe
him, but I have known him too long for that.
I wish I knew what he has in his head. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
is going to try to get his hands on that 'old
horse'; and if he does, I hope he will fail,
just as we have done. He need not think that
I am going to hold fast to him. I have had
one lesson through him, and that is enough."</p>

<p>Claus did not seem anxious to renew his
conversation with Casper. He had heard all
the latter's plans, as far as he had any, and
now he wanted to think up some of his own.
He walked up and down the platform with his
hands behind his back, all the while keeping
a bright lookout down the road for the
train.</p>

<p>"I must go to Denver, because I shall want
to make the acquaintance of some fellows
there whom I know I can trust," soliloquized
Claus. "I can get plenty of men in St.
Louis, but they are not the ones I want. I
must have some men who know all about
mining, and perhaps I can get them to scrape
an acquaintance with Julian. That will be
all the better, for then I can find out what he
is going to do. Well, we will see how it looks
when I get home."</p>

<p>For half an hour Claus walked the platform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
occupied with such thoughts as these,
and finally a big smoke down the track told
him the train was coming. He stuck his
head in at the door and informed Casper of
the fact, and when the train came up he
boarded one of the forward cars, leaving his
companion to do as he pleased.</p>

<p>"You are going to shake me," thought
Casper, as he stepped aboard the last car in
the train. "Well, you might as well do it at
one time as at another. I have all the money
I can get out of you, but I am not square with
you by any means. From this time forward
I'll look out for myself."</p>

<p>And the longer Casper pondered upon this
thought, the more heartily he wished he had
never seen Claus in the first place. He did
not sleep a wink during his ride to St. Louis,
but got off the train when it reached its destination
and took a straight course for his
room. The apartment seemed cheerless after
his experience on the train, but he closed the
door, threw himself into a chair, and resumed
his meditations, for thus far he had not been
able to decide upon anything.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<p>"I am hungry," thought he, at length,
"and after I have satisfied my appetite I will
do just what I told Claus&mdash;go around to the
different stores and ask them if they want a
boy. I tell you that will be a big come-down
for me, but it serves me right for having anything
to do with Claus."</p>

<p>We need not go with Casper any further.
For three nights he returned from his long
walks tired and hungry, and not a single
storekeeper to whom he had applied wanted
a boy for any purpose whatever. Sometimes
he had sharp words to dishearten him. "No,
no; get out of here&mdash;you are the fifth boy who
has been at me this morning;" and Casper
always went, for fear the man would lay violent
hands on him. On the fourth night he
came home feeling a little better than usual.
He had been hired for a few days to act as
porter in a wholesale dry-goods store, and he
had enough money in his pocket to pay for a
good supper. The wages he received were
small&mdash;just about enough to pay for breakfast
and supper; but when the few days were up
the hurry was over, and Casper was once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
more a gentleman of leisure. And so it was
during the rest of the summer and fall. He
could not get anything to do steadily, his
clothes were fast wearing out, and the landlord
came down on him for his rent when he
did not have a cent in his pocket. Utterly
discouraged, at last he wrote to his mother for
money to carry him to his home; and so he
passes out of our sight.</p>

<p>As for Claus, we wish we could dispose of
him in the same way; but unfortunately we
cannot. Everybody was glad to see him
when he entered the pool-room where he had
been in the habit of playing, and more than
one offered him a cigar. He told a long story
about some business he had to attend to somewhere
out West, and when he talked he
looked up every time the door opened, as if
fearful that Casper would come in to bother
him for more money. But Casper was sick
of Claus. The lesson he had received from
him was enough.</p>

<p>Claus remained in St. Louis for two months;
and he must have been successful, too, for the
roll of bills he carried away with him was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
considerably larger than the one which Casper
had seen. When he was ready to go he
bade everybody good-bye, and this time he
carried his trunk with him. He was going
out West to attend to "some business," which
meant that he was going to keep watch of
Julian and Jack in some way, and be ready
to pounce upon them when they worked their
mine&mdash;that is, if they were successful with it.</p>

<p>"That will be the only thing I can do,"
decided Claus, after thinking the matter over.
"They have the buildings by this time, at
any rate, so that part of it has gone up; but
when they get out alone, and are working in
their mine, that will be the time for me to
take them. They will have all the work, but
I will have the dust they make."</p>

<p>When Claus reached this point in his meditations,
he could not help remembering that
some of the men who were interested in the
mines were dead shots with either rifle or revolver,
and that if he robbed the boys he
would be certain to have some of them after
him, and what they would do if they caught
him was another matter altogether.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<p>"I can shoot as well as they can," thought
he, feeling around for his hip pocket to satisfy
himself that his new revolver was still in its
place. "If I have some of their money in
my pocket, I would like to see any of the
miners come up with me."</p>

<p>When Claus reached Denver, his first care
was to keep clear of Julian and Jack, and his
next was to find some miners who were
familiar with the country in the region bordering
on Dutch Flat; for thus far Claus had
not been able to learn a thing about it.
Dutch Flat might be five miles away or it
might be a hundred, and he wanted somebody
to act as his guide. He put up at a second-rate
hotel, engaged his room, and then came
down into the reading-room to keep watch of
the men who tarried there.</p>

<p>"I must find somebody whose face tells me
he would not be above stealing a hundred
thousand dollars if he had a good chance,"
decided Claus; "but the countenances of these
men all go against me&mdash;they are too honest.
I guess I'll have to try the clerk, and see what
I can get out of him."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

<p>On the second day, as Claus entered the
reading-room with a paper in his hand, he
saw before him a man sitting by a window,
his feet elevated higher than his head, watching
the people going by. He was a miner,&mdash;there
could be no doubt about that,&mdash;and he
seemed to be in low spirits about something,
for every little while he changed his position,
yawned, and stretched his arms as if he did
not know what to do with himself. Claus
took just one look at him, then seized a chair
and drew it up by the man's side. The man
looked up to see who it was, and then looked
out on the street again.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," began Claus, "but you seem
to be a miner."</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;I have dabbled in that a
little," answered the man, turning his eyes
once more upon Claus. "What made you
think of that?"</p>

<p>"I judged you by your clothes," replied
Claus. "Have a cigar? Then, perhaps you
will tell me if you know anything about
Dutch Flat, where there is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't I know all about it?" interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
the man. "Ask me something hard. A
bigger fraud than that Dutch Flat was never
sprung on any lot of men. There is no color
of gold up there."</p>

<p>"Then what made you go there in the first
place?" asked Claus.</p>

<p>"It got into the hands of a few men who
were afraid of the Indians, and they coaxed
me and my partner to go up," replied the
man. "But there were no Indians there. I
prospected around there for six months, owe
more than I shall ever be able to pay for grub-staking,
and finally, when the cold weather
came, I slipped out."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that," remarked Claus,
looking down at the floor in a brown study.
"I have a mine up there, and I was about to
go up and see how things were getting on
there; but if the dirt pans out as you say, it
will not be worth while."</p>

<p>"You had better stay here, where you have
a good fire to warm you during this frosty
weather," said the man, once more running
his eyes over Claus's figure. "If you have a
mine up there you had better let it go; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
are worth as much money now as you would
be if you stayed up there a year."</p>

<p>"But I would like to go and see the mine,"
replied Claus. "There was a fortune taken
out of it a few years ago, and it can't be that
the vein is all used up yet."</p>

<p>"Where <i>is</i> your mine?"</p>

<p>"That is what I don't know. I have somehow
got it into my head the mine is off by
itself, a few miles from everybody else's."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the haunted mine?" asked
the man, now beginning to take some interest
in what Claus was saying.</p>

<p>"I believe that is what they call it."</p>

<p>"It is five miles from Dutch Flat, straight
off through the mountains. You can't miss
it, for there is a trail that goes straight
to it."</p>

<p>"Do you know where it is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but that is all I do know
about it. I saw two men who went there to
work the pit, and who were frightened so
badly that they lit out for this place as quick
as they could go, and that was all I wanted to
know of the mine."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you have never been down in it?"</p>

<p>"Not much, I haven't!" exclaimed the
man, looking surprised. "I would not go
down into it for all the money there is in the
mountain."</p>

<p>"Did those men see anything?"</p>

<p>"No, but they heard a sight; and if men
can be so badly scared by what they hear, they
don't wait to see anything."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to go up there, and who can
I get to act as my guide?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you one thing," answered the
man, emphatically&mdash;"you won't get me and
Jake to go up there with you. I'll tell you
what I might do," he added, after thinking a
moment. "Are you going to stay here this
winter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I had thought of it. It is pretty
cold up there in the mountains&mdash;is it not?"</p>

<p>"The weather is so cold that it will take
the hair right off of your head," replied the
man. "If you will stay here until spring
opens, you might hire me and Jake to show
you up as far as Dutch Flat; but beyond that
we don't budge an inch."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>"How much will you charge me? And
another thing&mdash;do I have to pay you for waiting
until spring?"</p>

<p>"No, you need not pay us a cent. We have
enough to last us all winter. I was just wondering
what I was going to do when spring
came, and that made me feel blue. But if you
are going to hire us&mdash;you will be gone three
or four months, won't you?"</p>

<p>Yes, Claus thought that he would be gone
as long as that. Then he asked, "How far is Dutch Flat from here?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred miles."</p>

<p>The two then began an earnest conversation
in regard to the money that was to be paid
for guiding Claus up to Dutch Flat. The
latter thought he had worked the thing just
about right. It would be time enough to tell
him who Julian and Jack were, and to talk
about robbing them, when he knew a little
more concerning the man and his partner.
He had not seen the other man yet, but he
judged that, if he were like the miner he was
talking to, it would not be any great trouble to
bring them to his own way of thinking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>CLAUS HEARS SOMETHING.</h3>

<p>Never had a winter appeared so long
and so utterly cheerless as this one did
to Solomon Claus. The first thing he did,
after he made the acquaintance of Jake and
his partner, was to change his place of abode.
Jake was as ready to ask for cigars as Claus
had been, and the latter found that in order
to make his money hold out he must institute
a different state of affairs. He found lodgings
at another second-rate hotel in a distant
part of the city, but he found opportunity to
run down now and then to call upon Bob and
Jake,&mdash;those were the only two names he
knew them by,&mdash;to see how they were coming
along, and gradually lead the way up to talking
about the plans he had in view. It all
came about by accident. One day, when discussing
the haunted mine, Claus remarked
that he knew the two boys who were working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
it, and hoped they would have a good deal of
dust on hand by the time he got here.</p>

<p>"Then they will freeze to death!" declared
Bob. "What made you let them go there,
if you knew the mine was haunted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are not working it now," said
Claus. "They are in St. Louis, and are coming
out as soon as spring opens. They are
plucky fellows, and will find out all about
those ghosts before they come back."</p>

<p>"Yes, if the ghosts don't run them away,"
answered Bob. "I understood you to say
they are boys. Well, now, if they get the
better of the ghosts, which is something I
won't believe until I see it, and we should get
there about a month or two after they do, and
find that they have dug up dust to the amount
of ten or fifteen thousand dollars&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"But maybe the gentleman is set on those
two boys, and it would not pay to rob them,"
remarked Jake.</p>

<p>"No, I am not set on them," avowed Claus,
smiling inwardly when he saw how readily
the miners fell in with his plans. "I tried
my level best to get those boys to stay at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
home, for I don't want them to dig their
wealth out of the ground, but they hooted at
me; and when I saw they were bound to
come, I thought I would get up here before
them and see what sort of things they had
to contend with."</p>

<p>"What sort of relationship do you bear to
the two boys?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I am their uncle, and I gave them a block
of buildings here in Denver worth a hundred
thousand dollars and this haunted mine; but,
mind you, I did not know it was haunted
until after I had given it to them. But, boy
like, they determined to come up, brave the
ghosts, and take another fifty thousand out of
it."</p>

<p>Bob and Jake looked at each other, and
something told them not to believe all that
Claus had said to them. If he was worth so
much money that he was willing to give his
nephews a hundred thousand dollars of it, he
did not live in the way his means would
allow.</p>

<p>"And another thing," resumed Claus. "I
would not mind their losing ten thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
dollars, provided I got my share of it, for
then they would learn that a miner's life is
as full of dangers as any other. But remember&mdash;if
you get ten thousand, I want three
thousand of it."</p>

<p>This was all that Claus thought it necessary
to say on the subject of robbing the boys,
and after finishing his cigar he got up and
went out. Jake watched him until he was
hidden in the crowd on the street, and then
settled back in his chair and looked at Bob.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong with that fellow,"
he remarked. "His stories don't hitch;
he has some other reason for wishing to rob
those boys. Now, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You tell," retorted Bob. "He has something
on his mind, but he has no more interest
in that pit than you or I have. He
never owned it, in the first place."</p>

<p>"Then we will find out about it when we
show him the way to the Flat," said Jake.</p>

<p>"Oh, there will be somebody there working
the mine&mdash;I don't dispute that. But he
is no uncle to them two boys. But say&mdash;I
have just thought of something. We are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
going up there for three dollars a day; and if
we don't make something out of the boys,
what's the reason we can't go to headquarters?"</p>

<p>Jake understood all his companion would
have said, for he winked and nodded his head
in a way that had a volume of meaning in it.
The two moved their chairs closer together,
and for half an hour engaged in earnest conversation.
There was only one thing that
troubled them&mdash;they did not like the idea of
staying at Dutch Flat, among the miners,
until they heard how the boys were getting
on with their mine.</p>

<p>"You know they did not like us any too
well last summer," said Bob, twisting about
in his chair. "If we had not come away just
when we did, it is my belief they would have
ordered us out."</p>

<p>"Yes; and it was all on your account, too.
You were too anxious to know how much the
other fellows had dug out of their mines.
You must keep still and say nothing."</p>

<p>Claus went away from the hotel feeling
very much relieved. Bob and Jake had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
come over to his plans, and they had raised
no objection to them. The next thing was to
bring them down to a share in the spoils.
He was not going to come out there all the
way from St. Louis and propose that thing to
them, and then put up with what they chose
to give him.</p>

<p>"I must have a third of the money they
make, and that is all there is about it," said
he to himself. "They would not have known
a thing about it if it had not been for me.
Who is that? I declare, it is Julian and
Jack!"</p>

<p>The boys were coming directly toward him,
and this was the first time he had seen them
since his arrival in Denver, although he had
kept a close watch of everybody he had met
on the street. He stepped into a door, and
appeared to be looking for some one inside;
and when the boys passed him, he turned
around to look at them. The latter were in a
hurry, for it was a frosty morning, and they
felt the need of some exercise to quicken their
blood; besides, they were on their way to
school, in the hope of learning something that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
would fit them for some useful station in life.
They were dressed in brand-new overcoats,
had furs around their necks and fur gloves
on their hands, and Julian was bent partly
over, laughing at some remark Jack had
made. He watched them until they were
out of sight, and then came out and went on
his way.</p>

<p>"I tell you we are 'some,' now that we
have our pockets full of money," soliloquized
Claus, who grew angry when he drew a contrast
between his and their station in life.
"Most anybody would feel big if he was in
their place. But I must look out&mdash;I don't
want them to see me here."</p>

<p>Fortunately Claus was not again called
upon to dodge the boys in his rambles about
the city. He kept himself in a part of the
city remote from that which the boys frequented.
The winter passed on, and spring
opened, and he did not again see them; but
he heard of them through Bob and Jake, who
made frequent visits to the hotel where Mr.
Banta was located.</p>

<p>"I guess we saw your boys to-day," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Bob, who then went on to give a description
of them. "They have it all cut and dried
with Banta, and he is going to show them the
way to their mine. No, they did not mention
your name once. They are going to buy a
pack-horse, and load him up with tools and
provisions, and are going out as big as life."</p>

<p>"That is all right," said Claus. "Now, remember&mdash;I
am to have a third of the dust
you get."</p>

<p>"Of course; that is understood," answered
Jake, who now seemed as anxious to go to
Dutch Flat as he had before been to keep
away from it. "It would not be fair for us to
take it all. Where are you going after you
get the money?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got it yet," remarked Claus,
with a smile. "Those ghosts may be too
strong for the boys, and perhaps they will
come away without anything."</p>

<p>"Then we will pitch in and work the mine,
ourselves," said Bob. "They say that gold is
so thick up there that you can pick it up with
your hands. We won't come away and leave
such a vein behind us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span></p>

<p>"What about the ghosts?" queried Claus,
who could not deny he was afraid of them.
"They may be too strong for you, also."</p>

<p>"If they can get away with cold steel we'll
give in to them," said Jake. "But I'll risk
that. Where are you going when you get the
money? Of course you can't go back to St.
Louis."</p>

<p>"No; I think I shall go on to California.
I have always wanted to see that State."</p>

<p>"Well, we will go East. Three thousand
dollars, if they succeed in digging out ten
thousand, added to what we shall make&mdash;humph!"
said Bob; and then he stopped before
he had gone any further.</p>

<p>It was a wonder that Claus did not suspect
something, but his mind was too fully occupied
with other matters. Where was he going
when he got the money? That was something
that had not occurred to Claus before,
and he found out that he had something yet
to worry him.</p>

<p>"You fellows seem to think you will get
rich by robbing those boys," remarked Claus,
knowing that he must say something.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span></p>

<p>"No, we don't," answered Jake; "but that
will be enough to keep us until we can turn
our hands to some other kind of work. Now
about our pack-horse, tools and provisions.
You have money enough to pay for them, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;that is, I have a little," Claus
replied, cautiously, for he was afraid the
miners might want more of it than he felt
able to spend. "But I tell you I shall be
hard up after I get those things."</p>

<p>"You have other money besides what you
gave the boys," said Bob. "You can write to
St. Louis for more."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to do that. I have with
me just what I can spare, for my other funds
are all invested."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can get more for the sake of what
is coming to you," said Jake, carelessly.
"Now, we want to start for Dutch Flat in
about a week. That will give the boys time
to fight the ghosts and get to work in their
pit. Suppose we go and see about our pack-horse
and tools."</p>

<p>Claus would have been glad to have put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
this thing off for a day or two, but he could
not see any way to get out of it. He went
with the miners, who knew just where they
wanted to go, and the horse he bought was a
perfect rack of bones that did not seem strong
enough to carry himself up to Dutch Flat, let
alone a hundredweight of tools and provisions
with him. The tools he bought were to be
left in the store until they were called for, and
the miners drew a long breath of relief, for
that much was done. If Claus at any time
got sick of his bargain, and wanted to haul
out, he could go and welcome; but they would
hold fast to his tools and provisions, and use
them in prospecting somewhere else.</p>

<p>The morning set apart for their departure
came at last, and Claus and his companions
put off at the first peep of day. They made
the journey of two hundred miles without any
mishap, and finally rode into the camp of
Dutch Flat just as the miners were getting
ready to have their dinner. They all looked
up when they heard the newcomers, and some
uttered profane ejaculations under their breath,
while others greeted them in a way that Claus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
did not like, for it showed him how his partners
stood there with the miners.</p>

<p>"Well, if there ain't Bob I'm a Dutchman!"
exclaimed one, straightening up and shading
his eyes with his hand. "You are on hand,
like a bad five-dollar bill&mdash;ain't you? I was
in hopes you were well on your way to the
States by this time."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am here yet," answered Bob.
"You don't mind if I go and work my old
claim, do you? I don't reckon that anybody
has it."</p>

<p>"Mighty clear of anybody taking your
claim," said another. "You can go there and
work it, for all of us; but we don't want you
snooping around us like you did last summer."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with those fellows?"
asked Claus, when they were out of hearing.
"What did you men do here last summer?"</p>

<p>"Just nothing at all," replied Jake. "We
wanted to know how much gold everybody
was digging, and that made them jealous of
us."</p>

<p>"But if you can't mingle with them as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
did then, how are you going to find out about
the haunted mine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll mix with them just as we did
last year, only we sha'n't have so much to say
to them," said Jake. "Here is our claim,
and it don't look as though anybody had been
nigh it."</p>

<p>Claus was both surprised and downhearted.
If he had known that the miners were going
to extend such a reception as that to him he
would have been the last one to go among
them. There he was, almost alone, with two
hundred brawny fellows around him, each one
with a revolver strapped to his waist, and
their looks and actions indicated that if necessity
required it they would not be at all
reluctant to use them. He managed to gather
up courage to visit the general camp-fire,
which was kindled just at dark, where the
miners met to smoke their pipes and tell about
what had happened in their mines during the
day. This one had not made anything. The
dirt promised fairly, and he hoped in a few
days to strike a vein that would pay him and
his partner something. Another had tapped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
a little vein, and he believed that by the time
he got a rock out of his way he would stumble
onto a deposit that would make him so
rich that he would start for the States in short
order.</p>

<p>"Well, partner, how do you come on?"
asked the man who was sitting close to Claus,
who was listening with all his ears. "Does
your dirt pan out any better than it did last
summer?"</p>

<p>"We have not seen the color of anything
yet," replied Claus. "I do not believe there
is any gold there."</p>

<p>"You are a tenderfoot, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I never have been in the mines before."</p>

<p>"And you will wish, before you see your
friends again, that you had never seen them
this time. If you get any dust, you hide it
where your partners can't find it."</p>

<p>There was one man, who did not take any
part in the conversation, that kept a close
watch on Claus and listened to every word he
said. It was Mr. Banta, who wondered what
in the world could have happened to bring so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
gentlemanly appearing a man up there in
company with Bob and Jake.</p>

<p>"He must have money somewhere about
his good clothes, and that is what Bob is
after," said he to himself. "But if that is the
case, why did they not jump him on the way
here? I think he will bear watching."</p>

<p>Three nights passed in this way, Claus
always meeting the miners at the general
camp-fire, while his partners stayed at home
and waited for him to come back and tell
them the news, and on the fourth evening
Banta seemed lost in thought. He sat and
gazed silently into the fire, unmindful of the
tales that were told and the songs that were
sung all around him. At last one of the
miners addressed him.</p>

<p>"Well, Banta, I suppose this is your last
evening with us," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I go off to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you had not promised to
go up there?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't; I shall find out if the boys
are all right, anyway. That is what I care
the most about. I shall take some provisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
with me, and if the boys are above ground I
will leave them; otherwise, I shall bring them
back."</p>

<p>"Oh, the boys must have the better of the
ghosts by this time," said another; "they
would have been here before this time if they
had not. You will find them with more gold
stowed away than they know what to do
with."</p>

<p>"And didn't they see the ghosts at all?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that, I can't say. But they
have beaten them at their own game. You
will see."</p>

<p>Claus pricked up his ears when he heard
this, and when the miners had all drawn
away, one by one, and sought their blankets
in their lean-to's, he asked of the man who
sat near him, and who was waiting to smoke
his pipe out before he went to bed,</p>

<p>"Where is Banta going?"</p>

<p>"Up to the haunted mine," was the reply.
"You see, he went up there two weeks ago
with the boys, and promised to come back in
two weeks to see how they were coming on.
His two weeks are up to-night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span></p>

<p>"What is up there, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can ask somebody else to answer
that question," said the miner, getting
upon his feet. "I don't know what is up
there, and I don't want to know."</p>

<p>The miner walked off and left Claus sitting
there alone. He was certain that he was on
the right track at last. As soon as Banta
came back they would know something about
the haunted mine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>BOB TRIES STRATEGY.</h3>

<p>"Well, what did you hear this time?"
asked Bob, who lay on his blanket
with his hands under his head and a pipe in
his mouth. "Everybody kept still about the
haunted mine, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I heard about it to-night for the
first time," answered Claus. "Banta is going
up there to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then we will know something about it
when he comes back," remarked Bob. "I
hope the boys have got the better of those
ghosts in some way, and that they are working
their mine. Go on, and tell us what you
have heard."</p>

<p>Claus did not have much to tell, for the
miners had cut the conversation short; but
what little he did say created great excitement
between those who heard it now for the first
time. The boys had got the better of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
unearthly spirits in some way, for if the
ghosts had driven them out and not allowed
them to work their mine, the miners would
have found it out long before this time.</p>

<p>"I don't see why Banta put it off for two
weeks," said Jake; "I reckon he was afraid
of them spirits."</p>

<p>The next day was one which Claus often
remembered. There was much excitement in
the camp, although it did not show itself.
There was none of that singing and whistling
going on, but every man worked in silence.
Banta and his partner had got off at daylight,
and ten hours must pass away before they
could look for their return; but evening came
on apace, the camp-fire was lighted, and the
miners gathered around it and smoked their
pipes without making any comments on the
long delay of Mr. Banta and the man who
had gone with him. There was one thing
that troubled them, although no one spoke of
it&mdash;the mule which had carried their pack-saddle
came home alone, and was now feeding
in company with the old bell-mare. That
looked suspicious, but the men said nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
For an hour they sat around the fire, and then
one of them broke the stillness. He was an
old, gray-headed man, experienced in mining,
and of course all listened to what he had to
say. He spoke in a low tone, as if there had
been a patient there and he was afraid to
arouse him.</p>

<p>"Ten miles in ten hours," said he, knocking
the ashes from his pipe. "Boys, something's
got the better of those two men. I
remember that several years ago I was waiting
for a partner of mine who had gone away
to prospect a mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was that?" exclaimed a miner,
jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>"I heard something, but I don't know what
it was," said another.</p>

<p>It was done quicker than we could tell it.
In less than a second two hundred men sprang
to their feet, and two hundred hands slipped
behind them and laid hold of as many revolvers.
Of all those men, there was not one
who would have hesitated to fight Indians
with the fear of death before their eyes, but
there was not a single instance of a miner who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
did not change color at the sound of a noise
which seemed to come upon them from no one
could have told where.</p>

<p>"Which way did the noise come from?"
asked a miner.</p>

<p>"What did it sound like?" queried another.</p>

<p>"There it is!" said the miner who had at
first detected it&mdash;"it sounds like a horse's
hoofs on the rocks. There! Don't you
hear it?"</p>

<p>And so it proved. The noise was heard
plainly enough by this time, and in a few moments
more two men came out of the willows
and rode into the circle of light that was
thrown out by the camp-fire. They were
Banta and his partner; and one look at their
faces was enough&mdash;they were fairly radiant
with joy.</p>

<p>"Halloo! boys," cried Banta. "I declare,
you act as though you had lost your best
friend; and some of you have revolvers drawn
on us, too!"</p>

<p>"Say, pard," said one of the miners, shoving
his revolver back where it belonged and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
extending a hand to each of the newcomers,
"where have you been so long? Your pack-mule
has been home all the afternoon, and
has kept the camp in an uproar with her constant
braying. She acted as though she
wanted to see your horses. Did you see the
boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we saw the boys," answered
Banta. He did not seem in any particular
hurry to relieve the suspense of his friends,
which was now worked up to the highest
degree, but dismounted from his horse very
deliberately and proceeded to turn him loose.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you go on with it?"
asked another miner. "Were the boys all
right?"</p>

<p>"The boys were all right and tight, and
digging away as hard as they could."</p>

<p>"Did they&mdash;did they see the ghosts?"</p>

<p>"Of course they did; and the ghosts are
now lying up there with their skins off."</p>

<p>"Were they animals?"</p>

<p>"You are right again. Now, hold on till
I light my pipe and I'll tell you all about it.
Tony, you ought to have gone up there; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
would be ten thousand dollars better off than
you are this minute."</p>

<p>Tony was a man who was noted far and
near for his success in killing the lions which
were so abundant in the mountains. He would
rather hunt them than dig for gold, because
he was almost sure to get the animal he went
after. He was filling his pipe when Banta was
speaking, but he dropped it and let it lay on
the ground where it had fallen.</p>

<p>"It is the truth I am telling you," declared
Banta. "If you don't believe it, you can go
up there to that haunted mine and find out
all about it. The boys killed them with
nothing but revolvers."</p>

<p>Banta had his pipe lit by this time, and the
miners crowded around him, all eager for his
story. Bob and Jake were there, and no one
seemed to pay the least attention to them;
but they were impatient to learn all the particulars
of the case. There was one question
they wanted answered immediately, and that
was, Did the boys really have a bagful of
dust, or was Banta merely joking about that?
Fortunately Tony recovered his wits and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
pipe at the same time and asked the question
for them.</p>

<p>"Did the boys get ten thousand dollars in
two weeks?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, they brought a bag out for us to
examine, and they thought it was nothing
but iron pyrites," said Banta; and then he
went on smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>"We took one look at the bag," said his
partner, "and we took a big load off the boys'
minds when we told them it was gold, and
nothing else. Yes, sir&mdash;they have it fair and
square."</p>

<p>"The boys are going ahead as though there
had never been any ghosts there," said Banta;
and then he went on to tell the miners everything
that had happened during their trip to
the haunted mine; and when he got started,
he followed Julian's narrative, and paid no
attention to Jack's. It was certain that the
story did not lose anything by passing through
his hands.</p>

<p>"Jack pulled off his shirt," said he, in conclusion,
"and he has some wounds on his
back that will go with him through life."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span></p>

<p>"And is the gold as thick as they say it
is&mdash;so thick that one can pick it up with his
hands?"</p>

<p>"It is not quite as thick as that," replied
Banta, with a laugh. "But every time one
washes out a cradleful he finds anywhere from
a teaspoonful to three or four which he wants
to put in his bag. I tell you, the boys have
been lucky."</p>

<p>"I am going up there the first thing in the
morning," said a miner. "Here I have been
slaving and toiling for color for six months,
and I can hardly get enough to pay for my
provisions, but I'll bet it won't be that way,
now, much longer."</p>

<p>"Wait until I tell you something," answered
Banta. "Neely, you can go up there,
if you are set on it; there's no law here that
will make you stay away. There are plenty
of places where you can sink a shaft without
troubling the boys any, but whether or not
it will pay you is another question. The
boys will be down here themselves in less
than two weeks' time."</p>

<p>"How do you account for that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<p>"Their vein is giving out. It will end in
a deep ravine that is up there, and there their
color ends."</p>

<p>"Why don't they go back farther and start
another?" asked the miner.</p>

<p>"It won't pay. The man who started that
shaft upon which they are now at work was
a tenderfoot, sure enough. There is not the
first sign of color about the dirt anywhere.
He thought it was a pretty place and so went
to work, and the consequence is, it has panned
out sixty thousand dollars. But go ahead if
you want to, Neely."</p>

<p>Neely did not know whether or not he
wanted to go ahead with such a warning in
his ears. Banta was an experienced prospector,
and he could almost tell by looking at
the ground if there was any gold anywhere
about there. A good many who had been on
the point of starting for the haunted mine
with the first peep of day shook their heads,
and concluded they would rather stay where
they were than go off to a new country. There
were three, who did not say anything, whose
minds were already made up as to what they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
would do. They waited until the miners
were ready to go to their blankets, and then
Bob attracted the attention of those nearest
him by saying,</p>

<p>"What Banta says throws a damper on
me. The haunted mine is going to play out
in a day or two, this place here is not worth
shucks, and we are going off somewhere at
break of day to see if we can't do better than
we are doing here."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked one.</p>

<p>"I don't know, and in fact I don't care
much. I'll go to the first good place I hear
of, I don't care if it is on the other side of the
Rocky Mountains. I came out here expecting
to get rich in a few days, and I am poorer
now than I was ten years ago. These mountains
around here have not any gold in them
for me."</p>

<p>"And I say it is good riddance," whispered
the miner to some who stood near him. "If
you had acted as you did last year, you would
have been sent out before this time."</p>

<p>Having paved the way for the departure of
himself and companions, Bob joined them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
led the way into his own cabin. They seated
themselves close together, for they did not
want to talk loud enough to be heard by anyone
who was passing their camp.</p>

<p>"Well, they have it!" exclaimed Claus,
who was so excited that he could not sit still.</p>

<p>"And it is gold, too," declared Jake.
"Banta says so, and that is enough."</p>

<p>"In the morning, after we get breakfast,"
said Bob, "we'll hitch up and take the back
trail toward Denver. We will go away from
the haunted mine, and that will give color to
what I told them a while ago."</p>

<p>"What if you should chance to miss your
way?" asked Claus.</p>

<p>"You can't lose me in these mountains; I
have prospected all over them, and I have
seen where the haunted mine is located a
hundred times. What a pity it was that I
did not stay there. Sixty thousand dollars!
Jake, if we had that sum of money we would
be rich."</p>

<p>Jake did not say anything&mdash;that is, anything
that would do to put on paper. He
stretched himself out on his blanket and swore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
softly to himself, so that nobody but his companions
could hear him.</p>

<p>"That will be three thousand three hundred
dollars apiece," said Claus, who did not like
the way that Bob and Jake left him out
entirely. "Remember, I am to have a third
of it."</p>

<p>"Of course; and it will be more than that.
The boys will have some time to do more digging,
and maybe they'll have another bagful.
I understood you to say that the boys were
pretty plucky."</p>

<p>"You may safely say that," replied Claus.
"The way they stood up against those lions,
when they did not know what was onto them,
is abundant proof of that. You will have to
go easy when you tackle them, or some of you
will get more than you want."</p>

<p>The three continued to talk in this way
until they grew tired and fell asleep&mdash;that is,
all except Claus, who rolled and twisted on
his blanket for a good while before he passed
into the land of Nod. But he was out before
daybreak and busy with breakfast, while the
others brought up the animals and packed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
them for their journey. There was only one
man who came near them, and that was Banta,
who wanted to make sure they were not going
toward the haunted mine.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, are you going to leave us?"
he inquired. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Not giving you a short answer, we don't
care much <i>where</i> we go," replied Bob. "There
is nothing here for us, and we will go elsewhere.
We are going to take the back track."</p>

<p>"Are you not deciding on this matter suddenly?"</p>

<p>"We determined on it yesterday. We decided
to go up to the haunted mine if you
came back with a favorable report of the condition
of things, but you say the lead is
played out, and of course that knocks us.
Wherever we go, we can't find a much worse
place than this."</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I wish you luck, and we'll
all go away from here before a great while."</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious to find out about
where we are going?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to remind you to keep
away from that mine up the gully," answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Banta, looking hard at Bob while he spoke.
"The boys have that mine all to themselves,
and we are going to stand by them."</p>

<p>"We have no intention of going near that
haunted mine," asserted Bob, rather sullenly.
"If those boys have gold, let them keep it."</p>

<p>"All right! Then I have nothing further
to say to you."</p>

<p>So saying, Banta turned on his heel and
walked away. There was nothing insulting
in what he said, but Bob and his companions
knew that he was in earnest about it. They
all kept watch of him as long as he remained
in sight, and then looked at each other with
a broad grin on their faces.</p>

<p>"I guess Banta didn't make anything by
trying to pump me," said Bob. "When we
get a mile or two down the gully, we'll save
what little provisions we want, push our horses
over the bluff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do we want to do that for?" exclaimed
Claus, in great amazement. "Can't
we turn them loose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and have them come back here and
join the old bell-mare," said Jake, in disgust.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
"We have to be in a hurry about what we do,
for we must get a long start of the men here.
If our nags appeared among the other horses
here, the miners would know we had been
fooling them and would start for the haunted
mine at once."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we tie them up?" asked Claus;
"or, we could shoot them. That would be an
easier way than pushing them over the bluff."</p>

<p>"But there's the report our pistols would
make," replied Bob, turning fiercely upon
Claus. "The easiest way is the best. Now,
if we have everything we want, let us dig out
from here."</p>

<p>The men in the camp saw them when they
mounted their horses and started down the
gully toward Denver, but there was not one
who shouted a farewell after them. When
they disappeared from view, Banta drew a
long breath of relief.</p>

<p>"It is just as well that they took themselves
off before we had a chance to tell them that
their room was better than their company. I
do not like the way they have been acting
since they have been here."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>AN INHUMAN ACT.</h3>

<p>"I'll bet no men ever went away from a
camp before without somebody said
good-bye to them," said Jake. "They don't
care where we go, or what luck we have, provided
we don't go near the haunted mine. If
they will just stay that way until to-morrow,
they can all come on at once, if they have a
mind to."</p>

<p>Claus was the soberest man in the party.
He was waiting and watching for that bluff
at which their faithful steeds were to give up
their lives to make it possible for their owners
to get away with the amount they expected to
raise at the haunted mine. There was something
cold-blooded about this, and Claus could
not bring himself to think of it without shivering
all over.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you can't tie them there,"
Claus ventured to say; "they won't make any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
fuss until we are safely out of the way. It
looks so inhuman, to kill them."</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Bob, so fiercely that
Claus resolved he would not say anything
more on the subject&mdash;"if you don't like the
way we are managing this business, you can
just go your way, and we'll go ours."</p>

<p>"But you can't go yet," interrupted Jake;
"we are not going to have you go back to
Dutch Flat and tell the men there what we
are going to do. You will stay with us until
we get that money."</p>

<p>"Of course he will," assented Bob. "When
we get through with that haunted mine we'll
go off into the mountains, and then you'll be
at liberty to go where you please."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall stay with you," said
Claus, not a little alarmed by the threat thus
thrown out. Then he added to himself, "I
reckon I played my cards just right. If I
can keep them from searching me, I'll come
out at the big end of the horn, no matter
what happens to them."</p>

<p>For the next hour Claus held his peace;
but he noticed that his horse turned his head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
and looked down the gully as if he feared
they were not going the right away. He did
not remember that he had come that route before,
but concluded that Bob was gradually
leaving the trail behind them, and was veering
around to get behind the camp at Dutch
Flat. Then the mule which bore their pack-saddle
began to be suspicious of it, too, for he
threw up his head and gave utterance to a
bray so long and loud that it awoke a thousand
echoes among the mountains.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" exclaimed Jack, jerking impatiently
at his halter. "I hope that bluff is
not far away. We'll soon put a stop to your
braying when we get there."</p>

<p>In another hour they came upon the bluff,
one side of which was bounded by a deep
ravine that seemed to extend down into the
bowels of the earth, and the other was hemmed
in by lofty mountains which rose up so sheer
their tops seemed lost in the clouds above.
Here again the mule became suspicious, for, in
spite of the jerks which Jake gave at his
halter, he set up another bray that sounded
as if the mountains were full of mules.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold fast to him, Jake, until I take his
saddle off," said Bob, hastily dismounting
from his horse; "I can soon stop that, if you
can't. There&mdash;his pack is off. Take him by
the foretop&mdash;don't let him get away from you.
Now, then, look at you!"</p>

<p>The mule got away in spite of all Jake's
efforts to hold fast to him. The moment the
bridle was out of his mouth he dodged the
grab that Jake made for his foretop, and with
a flourish of his heels and another long bray
made for the gully by which he had entered
the bluff. The horses made a vain attempt
to follow him, and the animal on which Claus
was mounted seemed determined to go away,
but he was finally stopped by his rider before
he reached the gully. Bob and Jake were
fairly beside themselves with anger. Bob
stamped up and down so close to the ravine
that the least misstep would have sent him
over the brink, and Jake sat down on the
ground and swore softly to himself.</p>

<p>"I tell you, this won't do!" said Bob, coming
back to the horses. "Let us put them
over without the least delay; and, mind you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
we won't take their bridles off at all. That
mule will be in camp in less than an hour, so
we must make tracks. Let their saddles go,
too."</p>

<p>The men went to work at pushing the
horses over into the ravine as if they were in
earnest. First Bob's horse went; then Jake's;
and finally they took Claus's bridle out of his
hands and shoved his horse over, too. Claus
did not see any of this work. The animals
went over without making any effort at escape
beyond putting out their feet and trying
to push themselves away from the brink; but
the miners got behind them, and all their attempts
to save themselves amounted to nothing.
He heard the horses when they crashed
through the branches of the trees below him,
and then all was silent.</p>

<p>"What else could we do?" exclaimed Bob,
who thought Claus looked rather solemn over
it. "Dutch Flat is not a mile from here, and
some one there would have heard their whinnying.
I am sorry to do it, too, but when
there is ten thousand dollars in sight, I don't
stop at anything. Now pitch that mule's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
things over, also, and then we'll get away from
here."</p>

<p>This being done, the three, with a small
package of provisions on their shoulders, set
out once more at a rapid pace, Bob leading
the way.</p>

<p>For a long time no one spoke, the travelling
being so difficult that it took all their
breath to keep pace with Bob; but finally he
turned about and made a motion of silence
with his hand, and then they began to pick
their way through the bushes with more caution.
After a few moments he stopped,
pushed aside the branches of an evergreen,
and after taking a survey of the scene presented
to his gaze he made another motion,
which brought his companions up beside him.</p>

<p>"We have caught them at it!" said he.
'Julian is on top, and Jack is down below,
shovelling dirt. Where are your revolvers?"</p>

<p>"Those fellows from the Flat have not
come yet," said Jake, looking all around to
make sure that the boys were alone. "Lead
ahead, Bob, and remember that we are close
at your heels."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving his provisions behind him, Bob
arose to his feet, stepped out of his place of
concealment and advanced toward the pit.
Julian was so intent on watching his companion
below that he did not hear the sound
of their footsteps until they were so close to
him that he could not pull his partner up; so
he simply raised his head, and was about to
extend to them a miner's welcome, when he
saw something that made him open his eyes
and caused him to stare harder than ever.
There was something about that short, fleshy
man which he was sure he recognized. It did
not make any difference in what style of clothing
Claus was dressed in,&mdash;whether as a gentleman
of leisure or as a miner,&mdash;his face betrayed
him. He saw that it was all up with
him, for he had no time to go to the lean-to
after his revolver.</p>

<p>"Pitch that dirt out of the bucket and come
up, Jack," called Julian, shaking the rope to
attract the attention of his comrade. "Claus
is up here."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; then Jack's
voice came back in no very amiable tones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span></p>

<p>"Get away with your nonsense!" he exclaimed.
"If I come up there again for just
nothing at all, I pity <i>you</i>! If Claus is there,
make him show himself."</p>

<p>"Why, he's your uncle," asserted Bob, who
began to wonder if that was the first lie that
Claus had told them.</p>

<p>"That man?" exclaimed Julian. "Not
much, he ain't. Jack, is Claus your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Tell him to come down here and I'll see
about it," said Jack, who could not yet be
made to see that there was something really
going on at the top. "That makes two I
have against you, old fellow."</p>

<p>"No, you haven't got anything against
me," said Julian. "Here is Claus. Don't
you see his face? Any man who would claim
such an uncle as that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is enough out of you!" interrupted
Jake. "Fetch that partner of yours up, and
then bring out your money&mdash;we must get
away from here in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Well! well!" cried Jack, who happened
to look up and catch a glimpse of Claus's
face. "I will come up directly."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, you, down there," called Bob, bending
over the shaft, "if you have a revolver
down there, be careful that you keep it where
it belongs."</p>

<p>"Don't worry yourself," answered Jack;
"I haven't anything in the shape of a revolver
about me. Hoist away, Julian."</p>

<p>The dirt was emptied out by this time, and
Jack stepped into the bucket and was promptly
hoisted to the top. Then he stood waiting for
the three men to make known their wants;
but he devoted the most of his time to scrutinizing
the face of Claus, to whom he was indebted
for the presence of the other two.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could recognize me if
you should chance to meet me again anywhere?"
asked Claus.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I could," answered Julian; "I
would recognize you if I saw you in Asia.
You are bound to have some of that money,
are you not?"</p>

<p>"That is just what I am here for," said
Claus, with a grin. "You have one bagful
and another partly full, and we want them
both as soon as you can get them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p>

<p>Jack was astonished when he heard this,
for Mr. Banta had told him to keep the full
bag hidden where no one could find it. How,
then, did Claus know anything about it? Julian
was equally amazed; but, after thinking
a moment, he turned on his heel and led the
way toward their lean-to. Bob and his companion
kept close by the side of the two boys,
for they did not want them to find their revolvers
before they knew something about it.
They had heard from various sources that the
boys were fair shots, and they did not want to
see them try it on.</p>

<p>"Well, Claus, you slipped up on one
thing," said Julian; "you didn't get any of
that block of buildings&mdash;did you?"</p>

<p>"Come, now, hurry up!" insisted Bob.
"Where are those bags?"</p>

<p>"Here's one you have been talking about,"
answered Jack, pulling the head of his bed
to pieces and producing the article in question.
"Julian, you know where the other
one is."</p>

<p>While Jack was engaged in performing
this work the revolvers were kept pointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
straight at him, for fear he might pull out
another one and turn it loose upon them before
they could draw a trigger. But the boys
did not seem to care any more about the revolvers
than if they had been sticks of wood
that were aimed at them. Claus had a revolver,
but he did not seem inclined to use it.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is gold in here, and not
something else?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"You have got the bag in your hands, and
you can look and see for yourself," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"Go out in front of the lean-to and sit
down on the ground so that I can watch you,"
said Bob. "Jake, go with that boy and dig
up the other one. Is this all you have made
since you have been here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all. Now, what are you going
to do with us?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when Jake comes back. Is
there much more of that lead down there?"</p>

<p>"Well, you have charge of the mine, now,
and there is no law to hinder you from going
down and finding out," retorted Jack. "Claus,
where are you going? I don't expect to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
these gentlemen any more, but I should like
to keep track of you."</p>

<p>Claus did not see fit to answer this question,
and in the meantime Julian and Jake
returned with the other bag.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>A TRAMP WITH THE ROBBERS.</h3>

<p>"Oh, it is gold!" exclaimed Jake, as Bob
took the bag and bent over it; "it is
not iron pyrites."</p>

<p>"Stow that about your clothes, Jake, and
then we'll go on," said Bob; "and we want
you boys to gather up provisions enough to
last you for three or four days. But, in the
first place, where are your revolvers?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see them hung up there, in
plain sight?" asked Jack, pointing to the articles
in question, which were suspended from
the rack of the lean-to, in plain sight. "What
are you going to do with us?"</p>

<p>"We are going to take you a three days'
journey with us, and then turn you loose."</p>

<p>"Why can't you let us go now?" queried
Julian. "We have nothing else that is worth
stealing."</p>

<p>"No, but you are too close to Dutch Flat,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Jake replied. "We haven't got anything
against you, and when we get out there in the
mountains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might as well shoot us on the spot as
to lose us among these hills. I pledge you
my word that we will not stir a step&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is all very well," interrupted Bob
with a shake of his head which told the boys
that he had already decided on his plan;
"but, you see, it don't go far enough. If you
don't go to the miners, the miners will come
here to you, so we think you would be safer
with us. Gather up your grub and let us get
away from here."</p>

<p>The boy saw very plainly that Bob and
Jake wanted to make their escape from the
miners sure; so Julian collected some bacon
and hard-tack, which he wrapped up in a
blanket and fixed to sling over his shoulders.
There was one thing that encouraged him&mdash;"if
he did not go to the miners, the miners
would come after him"&mdash;and proved that
they must in some way have had their suspicions
aroused against Bob and Jake. Jack
also busied himself in the same way, and in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
very few minutes the boys were ready to
start.</p>

<p>"I must say you are tolerably cool ones, to
let ten or fifteen thousand dollars be taken
from you in this way," remarked Bob, who
was lost in admiration of the indifferent manner
in which the boys obeyed all orders. "I
have seen some that would have been flurried
to death by the loss of so much money."</p>

<p>"If Claus, here, told the truth, they have a
whole block of buildings to fall back on," answered
Jake. "But maybe that is a lie, too."</p>

<p>"No, he told you the truth there," said Julian.
"He tried to cheat us out of those
buildings while we were in St. Louis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never did it in this world!" declared
Claus, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Did you not claim to be our uncle?" asked
Julian.</p>

<p>"Uncle!" ejaculated Jack. "Great Scott!"</p>

<p>Claus did not attempt to deny this. Bob
and Jake were almost within reach of him,
and they looked hard at him to see what he
would say, and he was afraid to affirm that
there was no truth in the statement for fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
of something that might happen afterward.
He glanced at the boys, who were looking
steadily at him, and Jack moved a step or
two nearer to him with his hands clenched
and a fierce frown on his face, all ready to
knock him down if he denied it; so Claus
thought it best not to answer the question at
all.</p>

<p>"You won't think it hard of me if I hit
him a time or two?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Come here and behave yourself," said
Julian, walking up and taking Jack by the
arm. "I think, if the truth was known, he
is in a worse fix than we are."</p>

<p>"But he claims to be my uncle!" exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>The tone in which these words were uttered,
and Jack's anger over the claim of relationship,
caused Bob and Jake to break out
into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"We'll take your word for it," said Bob, as
soon as he could speak; "but we can't waste
any more time here. Follow along after me,
and Jake will bring up the rear."</p>

<p>Bob at once set off to the spot where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
had left their provisions, and, having picked
them up, led the way down the almost perpendicular
side of the ravine until they
reached the bottom. Now and then he would
look over his shoulder at Jack, who was following
close behind him, and would break
into another peal of laughter.</p>

<p>"So you didn't want that fellow to claim
relationship with you?" said he. "Well, I
don't blame you. He has done nothing but
tell us one pack of lies after another ever
since we met him. The only thing that had
the least speck of truth in it was that we
should find you here at the haunted mine."</p>

<p>This remark was made in a low tone, so
that it did not reach the ears of Claus, who
was following some distance behind. If Claus
had not seen already that he was in a "fix,"
he ought to have seen it now.</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps you wouldn't mind telling
us what you are going to do with us," Jack
ventured to say, in reply.</p>

<p>"Well, the men there at Dutch Flat are
hot on our trail now," asserted Bob.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span></p>

<p>"Because our mule got away from us when
we tried to shove him over the bluff. We
wanted to destroy everything we had that we
could not carry on our backs, but he got away
from us. Banta warned us against coming up
here, and we fooled him by making him believe
we were going straight down to Denver;
but he will be after us now. If he
comes, he had better take us unawares; that's
all."</p>

<p>"We don't want to see that fight," remarked
Jack. "You'll let us go before that
comes off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; when we get you so deep in the
mountains that you can't find your way back
readily, why, then we'll let you go. If you
behave yourselves, you won't get hurt."</p>

<p>Bob led the way at a more rapid pace when
they reached the bottom of the gorge, jumping
from rock to rock, and climbing over
fallen trees that lay in their road, and Jack
followed his example. He knew that Bob
was making the trail more difficult to follow,
but it was done in order to keep out of argument
with his charge; for Bob often stopped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
whenever he came to a place that took some
pains to get over, and saw that those who
were following him left no tracks behind
them.</p>

<p>"There!" said Bob, pulling off his hat and
looking back at the way they had come; "I
reckon Banta will find some trouble in tracking
us up here. I am hungry, and we'll stop
here and have something to eat."</p>

<p>After they had satisfied their appetites they
took a little time to rest, and then set off again
at a more rapid pace than ever. It was
almost dark when they stopped to camp for
the night. The boys were tired, and they
showed it as soon as they had disposed of
their bacon and hard-tack by wrapping their
blankets about them and lying down to sleep,
with their feet to the fire. Their slumber
was as sound as though they were surrounded
by friends instead of being in the power of
those who had robbed them of their hard-earned
wealth.</p>

<p>It seemed to them that they had scarcely
closed their eyes when they were awakened
by the sound of footsteps moving about, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
threw off their blankets in time to see Bob
cutting off a slice of bacon. It was as dark as
pitch in the woods, and the boys did not see
how Bob was to find his way through them.</p>

<p>"It will be light enough by the time we
have our breakfast eaten," said he, in response
to the inquiry of Julian. "You have a watch
with you. What time is it?"</p>

<p>Julian had a watch with him, it is true, but
he had been careful how he drew it out in the
presence of Bob and Jake. It had no chain
attached to it, and the boy was not aware that
Bob knew anything about it; but he produced
the gold timepiece and announced that it was
just five o'clock. This was another thing
over which Julian had had an argument with
Jack, who believed that, with the money he
had at his disposal, he ought to have the best
watch that could be procured, and, in spite of
Jack's arguments, he had purchased the best
American patent lever he could find. Jack's
watch was an ordinary silver one, and he said
that by it he could tell the time when dinner
was ready as well as he could by a good timepiece.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you want this watch?" asked Julian,
because he thought the man who would steal
his money would not be above stealing his
watch also.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Bob, with a laugh;
"you can keep that. I wanted your money,
and, now that I have it, I am satisfied."</p>

<p>By the time breakfast was cooked and eaten
there was light enough to show them the way,
and Bob once more took the lead. There was
no trail to guide them&mdash;nothing but the gully,
which twisted and turned in so many ways
that Julian almost grew heart-sick when he
thought of finding his way back there in company
with Jack. More than once he was on
the point of asking Bob if he did not think
they had gone far enough, but the man had
been so friendly and good-natured all the time
that he did not want to give him a chance to
act in any other way. So he kept with him
during that long day's tramp, looking into all
the gullies he crossed, and once or twice he
slyly reached behind him and pulled down a
branch of an evergreen that happened to come
in his way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the way our women used to do in
old Revolutionary times when they were captured
and wanted to leave some trail for their
rescuers to follow," soliloquized Julian; "but
Bob doesn't take any notice of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon we'll stop here for the
night," remarked Bob, when it got so dark
that he could scarcely see. "This is as far as
we shall ask you to go with us, Julian. I suppose
you are mighty glad to get clear of us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," assented Julian, honestly.
"If you will give us what you have in your
pockets, you can go your way and we will
make no attempt to capture you."</p>

<p>"Oh, we couldn't think of that! You
have wealth enough to keep you all your
lives, and I have struggled for ten years to
gain a fortune, and to-day I have just got it."</p>

<p>"What would you do if somebody should
catch you along the trail, somewhere? You
would come in for a hanging, sure."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose we know all that? It
is a good plan for you to catch your man before
you hang him. We have two revolvers
apiece, and you know what that means."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't count Claus worth anything,
then," remarked Jack.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, yes, we do," exclaimed Bob,
who wondered what Claus would think of him
for leaving him out entirely. "But Claus is
not used to this sort of business, you know.
He could make a noise, and that is about all
he could do."</p>

<p>"We know we should come in for a hanging
if those fellows at Dutch Flat should ever
get their hands on us, but when they do that
we'll be dead. You need not think we are
going to stay in this country, where everybody
has got so rich, and we be as poor as Job's
turkey all the while. We have just as good a
right to be rich as they have."</p>

<p>When Jake got to talking this way it was
a sure sign that he was rapidly getting toward
a point which Bob called "crazy." He was
always mad when he spoke of others' wealth
and his own poverty; and the boys, who were
anxious to get him off from that subject, began
their preparations for supper. They were
glad to know they had gone far enough with
the robbers to insure their escape, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
were disposed to be talkative; but they noticed
that Claus was more downhearted than
he had ever been. He lit his pipe, leaned
back against a tree, and went off into a brown
study.</p>

<p>"I suppose he'll get a portion of the money
that was stolen from us," said Jack, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"No, he won't," answered Julian in the
same cautious manner. "He has been promised
some of that money, but I'll bet you he
don't get a cent of it. He is here in these
fellows' power, and they'll take what they
please out of him."</p>

<p>The boys, although as tired as they were on
the previous day, were not by any means inclined
to sleep. In fact they did not believe
they had been asleep at all until they heard
Bob moving around the fire. It was five
o'clock by Julian's watch, and his first care
was to find out what had become of Claus,
who lay muffled up, head and ears, in his
blanket; but he would not have stayed there
if he knew what was going to happen to him
during the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>"Now perhaps you will be good enough to
tell us what route we have to travel in order
to get out of here," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Have you a compass with you?" asked
Jake.</p>

<p>No, the boys had none; they did not think
they would need one when they were surrounded
by friends who knew the woods, and
consequently they had not brought one with
them.</p>

<p>"You know which way is east, don't you?
Well, place your backs to the sun, and keep
it there all the time. Dutch Flat lies directly
west of here."</p>

<p>"That will be good if the sun shines all the
time," said Julian. "But if it goes under a
cloud&mdash;then what?"</p>

<p>"Then you will have to go into camp, and
stay until it comes out again," replied Bob.
"But at this time of the year you have nothing
to fear on that score. Are you going already?
Well, good-bye. Why don't you
wish us good luck with that money we took
from you?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't believe it will bring you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
good luck," said Jack. "We worked hard
for it, and we ought to have it. I wish you
good-bye, but I don't wish you good luck."</p>

<p>"Shake hands with your uncle, why don't
you?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Not much!" returned Jack. "If that
money doesn't bring him some misfortune I
shall miss my guess."</p>

<p>Julian and Jack shouldered the blankets
which contained the few provisions they had
left, plunged into the thicket, and were out
of hearing in a few minutes. The robbers sat
by the fire without making any effort to continue
their journey, and presently Bob turned
his eyes upon Claus.</p>

<p>"Now, my friend, it is time for you to go,
too," said he.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>HOME AGAIN.</h3>

<p>Claus had been expecting something of
this kind. It is true he had a revolver,
but by the time he could reach back
to his hip pocket and draw it he could be
covered by Jake, whose weapon lay close at
hand. There was but one thing to be done&mdash;he
had to surrender. Instead of getting three
thousand dollars for his share in the robbery,
he would be turned loose in that country, two
hundred miles from anybody, without a cent
left in his pockets&mdash;that is, if Bob searched
him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Claus, "I suppose you want
all the money I have around me. I should
think you might leave me a little."</p>

<p>"How much have you?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, Claus unbuttoned
his vest, worked at something on the inside,
and presently hauled out a belt, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
handed over to Bob. It did not stick out as
though there was much money in it, and when
Bob began to investigate it, all he drew forth
was twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>"You are a wealthy millionaire, I understood
you to say," exclaimed Bob, in great
disgust. "This looks like it!"</p>

<p>"I told you, when I had purchased the
pack-mule, provisions and tools, that I should
not have much left," answered Claus. "That's
all I have, and if you take it from me I shall
starve."</p>

<p>"Stand up!" commanded Jake, who was
as disgusted as Bob was. "You are sure you
haven't got any about your clothes? But,
first, I'll take possession of that revolver."</p>

<p>The revolver having been disposed of, Jake
then turned his attention to feeling in all
Claus's pockets, but he found nothing more
there&mdash;Claus had evidently given them the
last cent he had.</p>

<p>"Take your little bills," said Bob, throwing
Claus's belt back to him. "If you are
careful of them, they will serve you till you
get back to Denver."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<p>"And when you get there, you can go to
one of those men who own that block of
buildings and borrow another thousand or
two. Now, get out of here!" put in Jake.</p>

<p>"I thank you for this much," returned
Claus. "But I should thank you a good deal
more if you would give me my revolver. I
may want it before I reach Denver."</p>

<p>"Give it to him, Jake. He hasn't pluck
enough to shoot at us or anybody else. Make
yourself scarce about here!"</p>

<p>"They think they are awful smart!"
thought Claus, when he had placed some
bushes between him and the robbers. "Why
didn't they think to look in my shoe? I have
three hundred dollars that they don't know
anything about. Now I guess I'll go back to
St. Louis; and if anybody ever says anything
to me about an 'old horse,' I'll knock him
down."</p>

<p>We are now in a position to take a final
leave of Claus, and we do it with perfect readiness.
Did he get back to St. Louis in safety?
Yes, he got there in due course, but he had
some fearful sufferings on the way. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
first place, he was nearly a week in finding
his way out of the mountains; and by the
time he reached a miner's cabin he was so
weak from want of food that he fell prone
upon the floor, and stayed there until the
miner came from his work and found him
there. Of course he was taken in and cared
for, and when he was able to resume his journey
he offered to present the miner with every
cent he had,&mdash;twenty-five dollars,&mdash;to pay him
for his kindness; but the miner would not
take it.</p>

<p>"You will need every cent of that before
you get to Denver," said he. "The food and
care I have given you don't amount to anything.
Good-bye, and good luck to you."</p>

<p>He was nearly three times as long in finding
his way back to Denver. He tried to buy
a horse on the way, but no one had any to sell.
He now and then found a chance to ride when
he was overtaken by a teamster who was
going somewhere for a load, but the most of
his journey was accomplished on foot. His
long tramp never cost him a cent, for everybody
pitied his forlorn condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, if I had been treated this way
by those robbers I wouldn't look as bad as I
do now," Claus often said to himself; "I
would have seen California before I went
home."</p>

<p>All this while, Claus was on nettles for fear
he would see some of the men from Dutch
Flat who were in pursuit of him; but the
trouble was, the miners all went the other
way. They never dreamed that Claus was
going home, but saddled their horses at Mr.
Banta's command, and, making no attempt to
follow the devious course of the robbers
through the mountains, took the "upper
trail," and did their best to shut them off from
the towns toward which they knew the men
were hastening to buy some more provisions.
What luck they met with we shall presently
see.</p>

<p>No man ever drew a longer breath than
Claus did when he came within sight of Denver.
He went at once to the hotel where he
had left his clothes, but the landlord did not
recognize him and ordered him out of the
house; but he finally succeeded in making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
himself known; and, now that he was safely
out of reach of the miners at Dutch Flat,
he had some fearful stories to tell of his experience.</p>

<p>"You know I left my clothes with you on
condition that you would keep them for me
for a year," said Claus, who thought that was
the wisest thing that he ever did. "Well, I
want them now. I have the key to my
trunk, so everything is all right."</p>

<p>Claus was not long in recovering from the
effects of his journey, for he could not help
thinking that Mr. Banta, or some other man
who belonged to the Flat, would find out that
he had gone to Denver and come after him;
so he remained there but two days before he
took the cars for home.</p>

<p>"Now I am safe," said he, settling down in
his seat and pulling his hat over his eyes; "I
would like to see them catch me. But what
shall I do when I get back to St. Louis? I
must settle down into the same old life I have
always led, and that will be a big come-down
for me."</p>

<p>Claus is there now, spending his time at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
pool-rooms, where he makes the most of his
living, and ready at any time to talk about
the mines and the terrible experience he had
there.</p>

<p>And where were Julian and Jack all this
while? To begin with, they were in the
ravine, making all the haste they could to
leave the robbers behind and reach the
haunted mine before their provisions gave
out. That troubled them worse than anything.</p>

<p>"If our grub stops, where are we going to
get more?" asked Jack. "I don't believe
there is a house any nearer than Dutch Flat."</p>

<p>"And we can't get there any too soon," returned
Julian. "At any rate, we are better
off than Claus is. What do you suppose they
intend to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they intend to divide the
money with him. What makes you think
they would do anything else?"</p>

<p>"From the way they treated him. If we
could learn the whole upshot of the matter,
you would find that they don't intend to give
him a dollar."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we could see Mr. Banta for about
five minutes," said Jack. "I don't like to
give up that money. It is the first we ever
earned by digging in the ground, and I was
going to suggest to you that we keep some
of it."</p>

<p>Julian replied by lengthening his steps and
going ahead at a faster rate than ever. He,
too, did not like to confess that the money
was lost,&mdash;that is, if they could only get word
to Mr. Banta in time. He did not know
where the robbers were heading for; but, with
two hundred men at his back, Julian was certain
he could come up with them before they
had left the country entirely.</p>

<p>"But I hope they will not hurt the robbers,"
said Julian. "If they will just get the
dust, that is all I shall ask of them."</p>

<p>About five o'clock in the afternoon, when
it began to grow dark in the ravine, Julian,
who had been all the time leading the way,
stopped and pointed silently before him.
Jack looked, and there was the camp they
had occupied two nights before.</p>

<p>"We are on the right road, so far," said he.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
"If we don't miss our way to-morrow we are
all right."</p>

<p>The boys had not stopped to eat any dinner,
and for that reason they were hungry. They
spent a long time in cooking and eating their
bacon, and Julian said there was just enough
for two more meals. He did not like to think
of what might happen when it was all gone,
and, after replenishing the fire, bade his companion
good-night, wrapped his blanket about
him, and laid down to rest; but sleep was out
of the question. A dozen times he got up to
see the time, and there was Jack, snoring
away as lustily as he had done at the haunted
mine. Julian wished that he, too, could forget
his troubles in the same way, but when
morning came he had not closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Julian proved to be an invaluable guide,
for that night they slept in the first camp they
had made after leaving the haunted mine.
If he had always known the path, he could
not have brought his companion straighter
to it.</p>

<p>"Now keep your eyes open for the trail we
made when we came down from our mine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
and then we are at home. But I say, Julian,
I shall not be in favor of staying here. All
our money is gone, I don't feel in the humor
to work for any more, and we will go down
to Dutch Flat."</p>

<p>"And we'll stay there just long enough to
find somebody starting out for Denver, and
we'll go with him," replied Julian. "I don't
want anything more to do with the mines as
long as I live."</p>

<p>The night passed away, and the next morning,
without waiting to cook breakfast, the
two boys started to find the trail that led up
the bluff to the haunted mine. They were a
long time in finding it&mdash;so long, in fact, that
Julian began to murmur discouraging words;
but finally Jack found it; and now began the
hardest piece of work they had undertaken
since they left the robbers. The cliff was as
steep as it looked to be when they gazed down
into its depths from the heights above, and
they did not see how they had managed to
come down it in the first place.</p>

<p>"Are you sure the mine is up here?" asked
Julian, seating himself on a fallen tree to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
rest. "I should not like to go up there and
find nothing."</p>

<p>"Didn't you see the trail we made in
coming down?" inquired Jack. "Of course
we are on the right track; but if you spend
all your time in resting, we shall never be
nearer the top than we are this minute."</p>

<p>Julian once more set to work to climb the
hill, and in half an hour more Jack pushed
aside some branches that obstructed his way
and found himself in plain view of the mine.
Julian was satisfied now, but declared he
could not go any farther until he had recovered
all the wind he had expended in going
up the bluff; but Jack wanted to see that
everything in the camp was just as they left
it. He walked on toward the lean-to, and the
first thing that attracted his attention was that
his goods had been disturbed. The skins were
gone, some of the blankets were missing, and
there were hardly provisions enough to get
them a square meal. Julian came up in response
to his call, and was obliged to confess
that there had been other robbers while they
were absent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us dish up the few provisions left,
take those things we want to save, and dig out
for the Flat," said Julian. "I am sure there
is nothing here to keep us, now."</p>

<p>"And we'll leave the dirt-bucket here for
somebody else to use," added Jack. "If he
thinks there is a lead down there, let him go
and try it. I did not send up enough dust
the last time I was down there to pay for the
rope."</p>

<p>At the end of an hour the boys resumed
their journey, each one loaded with a few
things they wanted to save, and in two hours
more they arrived within sight of Dutch
Flat. Some few of the men had already
given up their workings and were sitting in
front of the store, smoking their pipes; but
one of them speedily caught sight of the
boys, and the miners broke out into a cheer.
In a few seconds more they were surrounded,
shaking hands with all of them, and trying
in vain to answer their questions all at once.</p>

<p>"This is no way to do it," declared Julian.
"Let us put our things in the cabin and
get our breath, and I will tell you the story."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span></p>

<p>"In the first place," began Jack, as he deposited
the things with which his arms were
filled and came out and seated himself on the
doorsteps of Mr. Banta's cabin, "let me ask
a few questions. I won't delay the story five
minutes. Where is the man who owns this
house?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Banta?" said one of the miners.
"He took the upper trail two or three days
ago, and rode with all possible speed in the
direction of Mendota. He hopes in that way
to cut off those villains."</p>

<p>"He will do it, too, for they have no
horses," said Julian.</p>

<p>"No horses? What did they do with
them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure," answered Julian,
in surprise. "They were on foot when
they came to rob us."</p>

<p>"Why, their mule came up here a few
hours after they left, and made the biggest
kind of a fuss, and Banta suspected something
at once. He called for some men to go with
him, and he went as straight as he could to
your mine. You were not there, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
proved that those miners had paid you a
visit."</p>

<p>"We are going to get our dust again!"
said Julian, slapping Jack on the shoulder.
"But I hope they won't hurt the robbers after
they catch them."</p>

<p>"Well, that is rather a difficult thing to
tell. A man who comes into a mining-camp
and watches his chance to steal money instead
of working for it, takes his life in his
hand."</p>

<p>"Then they must have been the ones who
disturbed our things," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Probably they were. They brought the
skins of the ghosts back, and also some of
your provisions. They are there in his cabin
now. Now let us have that story."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>When Julian had fairly settled down to
tell his story, which he did by crossing
his right leg over his left leg and clasping
his hands around his knee, he discovered
that there was not so much to be told as he
had thought for. His adventure with the robbers
was nothing more than might have happened
to any one of the miners who were
standing around him; the only question in
his mind was, would the other miner have
fared as well as he did?</p>

<p>"They came to our mine and stole our
dust; but I don't see how they found out
about the full bag. Mr. Banta told us to be
careful about that."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Banta told it himself!" remarked
one of the miners. "He said you
had a bagful hidden away."</p>

<p>"You see, he had to do it, or the men here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
would have become suspicions and gone up to
your mine in a body," explained another.
"Go on&mdash;what next?"</p>

<p>"They took the full bag, as well as the half-empty
one, and told us we would have to go
with them on a three days' journey into the
mountains, so as to keep you fellows here in
ignorance of the robbery as long as possible
but they took us only a two days' journey,
and then told us we had gone far enough.
That's all there was of it."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to tell?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Well, no. They went away from here on
horseback, you said. Now, what did they do
with their animals? They were on foot when
they came to see us, and they never said
'horses' once during the two days we were
with them."</p>

<p>"Probably they rode their horses as far as
they could, and then killed them."</p>

<p>"No doubt they pushed them over a bluff,"
said a man who had not spoken before.</p>

<p>"We did not see any horses; of that much
we are certain. The only thing I can't see
into is, what they did with Claus after we went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
away. Of course they agreed to give him a
portion of the money they got off us."</p>

<p>"Maybe so, but I don't think they did it.
Go on&mdash;how did they treat you?"</p>

<p>"As well as they knew how," answered Julian,
emphatically. "That is the reason why
I hope Mr. Banta will be kind to them if he
catches them."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll see how he'll treat them," retorted
a miner. "You'll never see those three
men again."</p>

<p>Julian became uneasy every time the men
spoke of the way the miners would use their
prisoners if they found them, but he knew it
would be of no use to say a word. If anything
was done to them, he was in hopes the miners
would get through with it before they came to
camp. He was not used to any Western
way of dealing with criminals, and he thought
he was getting too old to become used to it
now.</p>

<p>This was the way Julian told his story, in
answer to numerous questions of the miners,
who finally heard all they wanted to know.
In regard to what had happened to Claus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
none of the miners had any idea. He did not
get any of the dust that was stolen from the
boys, and he would be lucky if he got away
with a dollar in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I have been on the watch
for them fellows to get into a squabble of some
kind before we saw the last of them?" remarked
a miner. "That Bob was a regular
thief&mdash;one could tell that by looking at him.
The short, pursy fellow&mdash;you called him
Claus, didn't you?&mdash;looked like a gentleman;
but his face did not bear out his good
clothes."</p>

<p>The miners then slowly dispersed, one after
the other,&mdash;some to their work, and some to
lounge in front of the grocery, smoking their
pipes,&mdash;and the boys were left to themselves.
Their first care was to get something to eat,
for they had not had a sufficient quantity of
food, the bacon and hard-tack they first put
into their blankets having disappeared until
there was none left. Provisions were handy
in Mr. Banta's cabin, and when they had got
fairly to work on it they heard a sound from
the miners whom they had left outside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span></p>

<p>"Here they come!" shouted a voice. "Now
we'll see what will be done with those prisoners!"</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in blank
amazement. They had caught the robbers, so
their dust was safe; but what were they going
to do with the culprits, now that they had
captured them?</p>

<p>"I declare," said another miner, at length,
"they haven't brought any prisoners with
them! And there's Tony, with his arm tied
up in a sling!"</p>

<p>The boys had by this time reached the
door, and saw Mr. Banta, accompanied by a
dozen miners, ride into the camp. The boys
looked closely at them, but could not see anybody
that looked like Bob and Jake; but
Tony did not seem to have left all the fight
there was in him up in the mountains, for
he raised his rifle and flourished it over his
head.</p>

<p>"Halloo! Mr. Banta," shouted Julian.
"You meant to catch them, did you? But I
guess you came out at the little end of the
horn."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there!" exclaimed Mr. Banta, stopping
his horse and addressing himself to his
men; "didn't I tell you those boys would
come back all right? Put it there, kids!"</p>

<p>Julian and Jack shook hands with all the
returning miners before they saw an opportunity
to propound any other questions; and
then, when they did ask them, they did not
get any satisfactory answers.</p>

<p>"Did you get our dust?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! And the men&mdash;ah!" said Mr.
Banta, who stopped and looked around at
the miners as if he hardly knew what to say
next.</p>

<p>"Well, what about the men?" inquired Julian.
"You saw them, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we saw the men; and when we
asked them where the dust was that they stole
down here at the haunted mine, they took it
out of their clothes and gave it to us. Ain't
that so, boys?"</p>

<p>The men around him nodded their heads
emphatically, as if to say their leader had
told nothing but the truth, but there was
something in their faces that told a different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
story. The boys concluded they would ask no
more questions while Mr. Banta was around,
but when he went away they were sure they
would get at the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>"And, Julian, there's your money," continued
Mr. Banta, who had been trying to
take something out of his coat-pocket. "There
is the full bag, and there is the other. The
next time I leave you with such an amount
of money to take care of, I'll give you my
head for a football."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Banta, <i>you</i> told them all about
this!" asserted Jack, laughingly.</p>

<p>"No, I never!" shouted Mr. Banta.</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell the men what we had done
and all about the dust we had?" asked Julian.
"You <i>did</i> tell them, and the robbers were
sitting by the camp-fire, and heard it all."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, well&mdash;I did say&mdash;I could not
well help it&mdash;let us go into the cabin and see
what you have to eat."</p>

<p>Mr. Banta lost no time in getting into the
cabin, for the boys had asked a question he
could not answer, and when they followed him
in he was engaged in filling his pipe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span></p>

<p>"We rode to the haunted mine and found
you were not there, so we came back and took
the upper trail on the way to Mendota," said
the miner, talking rapidly, as if he hoped to
shut off any questions the boys might have
ready to ask him. "We had a good time. We
found the men there and asked them for the
money, and they gave it over as peaceable and
quiet as could be. Now, don't let us hear any
more about it. You know the whole of the
story. Is this all you have to ease a man's appetite?
Why, I could eat it all myself!"</p>

<p>"That's a funny story," whispered Jack, as
he and Julian went to the spring after a
bucket of water.</p>

<p>"Well, keep still," said Julian. "He told
us not to say anything more about it, and
that's just the same as an order. We'll get
the straight of the matter yet."</p>

<p>"Who will you go to?"</p>

<p>"We'll go to Tony for it. He was the man
who was shot in the fracas, and he will tell us
all about it."</p>

<p>It was two days before Julian had an opportunity
to speak to Tony in private. Tony's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
right arm was injured so badly that he could
not use a shovel, and the boys volunteered to
go down in his mine and help him&mdash;a voluntary
act on their part which gained them the
good-will of all the miners. One day, when
Tony was sitting by his mine smoking his
pipe and Julian was waiting for Jack to fill
up their bucket, the latter thought the chance
had come, for Tony was unusually talkative
that morning.</p>

<p>"Now, there is no need that you should
keep this thing away from us any longer,"
said Julian, suddenly. "Who shot those two
men?"</p>

<p>Tony was taken off his guard and looked
all around as if he was waiting for some one
to suggest an answer. Finally he took off
his hat and dug his fingers into his hair.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about shooting a
man?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No one has said anything about it this
morning, but I just want to know if everything
I suspect is true," answered Julian, with
his eyes fastened on Tony's face.</p>

<p>"Some one who was there can't keep his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
mouth shut," remarked Tony, in great disgust.
"Mr. Banta said he didn't want you
to know anything about it, and here that man
has gone and blowed the whole thing! But
you'll remember that I didn't say a word about
it&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"No one shall ever know what you tell
me," asserted Julian. "Did you shoot
them?"</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't help it&mdash;could I? We
came up with them just before we got to Mendota.
We rode right plump onto them before
we knew it, and without saying a word they
began to shoot. If they had had rifles, some
of us would have gone under; but they had
nothing but revolvers, and the first thing I
knew something went slap through my arm,
and I began to shoot, too. I got in two shots
while you would be thinking about it, and
then Mr. Banta looked through their clothes
and got the dust. We went down to Mendota
and reported the matter to the sheriff,
and he sent up and buried them."</p>

<p>"It is a wonder to me that they didn't
arrest you," said Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span></p>

<p>"Who&mdash;me? What did I do? The men
were shooting at us, and I was defending myself.
It would have taken more men than
they had there to arrest me, for any man
would have done the same. Anyhow, we got
your money back. Say! Don't lisp a word
of this to Mr. Banta. He would go for me
hot and heavy."</p>

<p>Julian was obliged to promise again that
Mr. Banta should never hear a word of what
Tony had told him; but that night he told it
to Jack, who said that his "funny story" had
come out just as he thought it would.</p>

<p>"You said you didn't want them to deal
with the culprits here in camp, and you have
your wish," said Jack.</p>

<p>Not long after that the miners, discouraged,
packed up, by companies of half a dozen or
more, bid good-bye to their associates, and
struck out for other localities. Dutch Flat
was "played out," there was no gold there for
them, and they were going where they could
do better. Some of them talked of going
home, while others, whose "piles" were not
quite as large as they wished, were going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
try it again for another year. Mr. Banta lingered
there for some time, and then he, too,
astonished the boys by bringing up his tools
and telling them that next day he would strike
for Denver.</p>

<p>"And when I get there I don't think I
shall stop," said he. "I have been away from
my home in the granite hills so long that I
won't know how to act when I get there, and
I can't learn any younger than I can now. I
am going as far as St. Louis with you, and
then I shall strike off alone."</p>

<p>This put new life into the boys. As soon
as it became known in camp that Mr. Banta
was going away, a dozen others joined in with
his party, and when they rode away from the
camp the few miners who were left behind
cheered themselves hoarse. The boys had
been "to the mines," had met with some adventures
while there, and they were ready to
go back among civilized people once more.</p>

<p>Their stay in Denver did not last more
than a week, and the boys were made to
promise, over and over again, that after they
had seen their friends in St. Louis they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
would go back there to live. Everything
they had in the world was there, the Western
country seemed to agree with them, and there
they would remain. They had not yet completed
their course at the business school, and
when that was done they must look for some
useful occupation in which to spend their lives.</p>

<p>Mr. Banta proved that he had some money
in the bank before he had been in Denver
two days. The boys left him at his old
hotel, clad in a miner's suit, and looking altogether,
as he expressed it, "like a low-down
tramp," and when they saw him again they
could hardly recognize him. The barber had
been at work on him, the tailor had done his
best to fit him out; but the squeeze he gave
their hands proved that he was the same "old
Banta" still. The boys never forgot him;
his kindness had saved them many a dollar.</p>

<p>After taking leave of Mr. Banta at St.
Louis the boys took up their quarters at a
leading hotel, and for two weeks devoted
themselves to calling upon their friends. As
they signed their names to the register Julian
whispered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>

<p>"I have often thought, while I have been
carrying messages here in the city and looked
into this hotel while hurrying past it, that the
men who could put up at a first-class house
like this must be a happy lot, and now I have
a chance to see how it goes myself. Jack, let
us go down and have a glass of soda water.
Why don't you grumble about that the way
you did the last time we were here?"</p>

<p>But Jack did not feel like grumbling&mdash;he
was too happy for that. He did not think,
while he was finding fault with Julian for the
wages he had spent at the express office in
buying 'old horse,' that he was one whose
fortunes hung upon the letter that was to
tell him about The Haunted Mine.</p>

<p class="center p2"><b>HOW I CAME TO WRITE MY FIRST BOOK.</b></p>

<p>When I was sixteen years old I belonged to a composition
class. It was our custom to go on the recitation seat
every day with clean slates, and we were allowed ten minutes
to write seventy words on any subject the teacher
thought suited to our capacity. One day he gave out "What
a Man Would See if He Went to Greenland." My heart was
in the matter, and before the ten minutes were up I had one
side of my slate filled. The teacher listened to the reading
of our compositions, and when they were all over he simply
said: "Some of you will make your living by writing one
of these days." That gave me something to ponder upon.
I did not say so out loud, but I knew that my composition
was as good as the best of them. By the way, there was
another thing that came in my way just then. I was reading
at that time one of Mayne Reid's works which I had
drawn from the library, and I pondered upon it as much as
I did upon what the teacher said to me. In introducing
Swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression:
"No visible change was observable in Swartboy's countenance."
Now, it occurred to me that if a man of his education
could make such a blunder as that and still write a
book, I ought to be able to do it, too. I went home that very
day and began a story, "The Old Guide's Narrative," which
was sent to the <i>New York Weekly</i>, and came back, respectfully
declined. It was written on both sides of the sheets
but I didn't know that this was against the rules. Nothing
abashed, I began another, and receiving some instruction,
from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store, I
wrote it on only one side of the paper. But mind you, he
didn't know what I was doing. Nobody knew it; but one
day, after a hard Saturday's work&mdash;the other boys had been
out skating on the brick-pond&mdash;I shyly broached the subject
to my mother. I felt the need of some sympathy. She
listened in amazement, and then said: "Why, do you think
you could write a book like that?" That settled the matter,
and from that day no one knew what I was up to until I sent
the first four volumes of Gunboat Series to my father. Was
it work? Well, yes; it was hard work, but each week I had
the satisfaction of seeing the manuscript grow until the
"Young Naturalist" was all complete.&mdash;<i>Harry Castlemon in the Writer.</i></p>

<p class="center b1 p6">J. T. TROWBRIDGE.</p>

<p>Neither as a writer does he stand apart from the great
currents of life and select some exceptional phase or odd
combination of circumstances. He stands on the common
level and appeals to the universal heart, and all that he suggests
or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of
the great body of humanity.</p>

<p>The Jack Hazard series of stories, published in the late
<i>Our Young Folks</i>, and continued in the first volume of <i>St.
Nicholas</i>, under the title of "Fast Friends," is no doubt
destined to hold a high place in this class of literature. The
delight of the boys in them (and of their seniors, too) is
well founded. They go to the right spot every time. Trowbridge
knows the heart of a boy like a book, and the heart
of a man, too, and he has laid them both open in these books
in a most successful manner. Apart from the qualities that
render the series so attractive to all young readers, they
have great value on account of their portraitures of American
country life and character. The drawing is wonderfully
accurate, and as spirited as it is true. The constable, Sellick,
is an original character, and as minor figures where will
we find anything better than Miss Wansey, and Mr. P. Pipkin,
Esq. The picture of Mr. Dink's school, too, is capital,
and where else in fiction is there a better nick-name than
that the boys gave to poor little Stephen Treadwell, "Step
Hen," as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate
moment when he saw it in print for the first time in his lesson
in school.</p>

<p>On the whole, these books are very satisfactory, and
afford the critical reader the rare pleasure of the works that
are just adequate, that easily fulfill themselves and accomplish
all they set out to do.&mdash;<i>Scribner's Monthly.</i></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
